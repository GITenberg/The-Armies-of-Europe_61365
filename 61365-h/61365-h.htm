<p class="preface">âLet him who is desirous of peace prepare himself
for war.â Thus runs the proverb which sums up the experiences and
history of the most powerful Empire of old. If this maxim held good in
the old Roman days, how much more applicable is it to the present time,
when war-clouds are darkening the horizon, and threaten to burst in
ruin and devastation on all nations who have not heeded the warning!
There are, however, few who have not heeded it, and the governments of
all nations have been for some time, and are still, reorganising their
Armies and bringing them to a high state of efficiency in accordance
with the experience taught them by the great wars of the last thirty
years.</p>

<p class="preface">It is therefore necessary for all who take an
interest in military matters, or in foreign politics, to become
acquainted with the strength and organisation of the armed forces of
the different European Powers, for it is only by a study of these
Armies that we get to know the relative value of our own.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> British Army is constructed on a
purely original system. It is like no other army in the world, and for
this very good reason, that there is no empire in the world like the
British Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The British Empire.</div>

<p class="sind">Great Britain and Ireland alone do not constitute
the Empire. India, Australia, Canada, the Cape, and shoals of other
colonies in every quarter of the globe, all help to build it up, and
for its defence we must have an Imperial Army constructed to fit it.
Let us see what we have got.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes us about the Army is that, although of
a decent size, it is not by any means too largeâin fact, some people
say that it is nothing like large enough. That, however, is a question
which chiefly concerns the British taxpayer and his pocket, and with
which we have nothing to do at this moment, so we will confine
ourselves to contemplating its actual size.</p>

<p>The Empire contains, roughly, over 9,000,000 of
square miles, and over 326,000,000 of inhabitants. To defend these we
have an Army which numbers roughly as follows:â</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strength of Imperial Army.</div>

<p class="noindent">altogether, 864,000 men at the outside. This
apparently large number, however, includes every single able-bodied
man, British or Native, who has been trained to bear arms: the Regular
Army forms not quite a quarter of it. Taken altogether, this gives an
average of about 1 combatant to 350 non-combatantsânot a large
proportion. Germanyâs proportion is 1 to 99. This is a large
proportion, it is true, but then she is threatened by powerful enemies
on her eastern and western frontiers, whereas we are an island, and
look to our Navy as the first line of defence. This being so, we can do
with a moderately small Army, and need not (yet) have recourse to the
system of all other European countriesânamely, universal
conscription.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig001">
<img class="smallbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig001.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Mounted Infantry.<br />
       (Tropical Field Kit.)</p>
</div>

<p>It is absolutely necessary, however, that we should follow the
principle which underlies the military systems of all countries,
whether their armies are composed of conscripts or not. This principle
is that of keeping a small number of troops under arms in peace-time,
with a large reserve of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
trained men ready to be called out in case of war. In our case, the
small number under arms in peace-time is represented by the Active
Army, both British, Indian, and Colonial,<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and the large reserve by the 1st and 2nd Class Army Reserves, the
Militia, the Militia Reserve, the Yeomanry, and the Volunteers.</p>

<p>Before starting on the details of these different forces, it would
be as well to give the mode of enlistment and terms of service of the
British soldier, with a slight sketch of his history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Recruit&shy;ment.</div>

<p class="sind">The system of recruitment throughout the Army is
that of voluntary enlistment. As mentioned above, we are the
<i>only</i> country in Europe whose soldiers are thus enlisted. The
subjects of all other European countries are liable to be enrolled in
the army whether they like it or not, and, as a rule, they do not like
it. This voluntary enlistment is a great advantage for us in one way,
in that only those need be soldiers who want to be; but, on the other
hand, the strength of our Army is chiefly dependent on the number of
men who happen to fancy soldiering, and this is hardly a matter for
congratulation. Up till now, the system has sufficed: let us hope we
shall never have to change it.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that there exists
an Act<a id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which has to be suspended annually
by Parliament (or else it would now be in force), by which the Crown is
empowered to raise by ballot as many men as may be necessary for the
Army. In other words, the country <i>is</i> liable to conscription, as
far as may be determined by the Crownâs advisers. This Act has, however,
not been enforced since 1815. N.B.âThis mode of raising troops must not
be confounded with the âEmbodiment of the Militia,â of which more
hereafter.</p>

<p>Recruiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
is carried out by paid recruiters (non-commissioned officers) in the
different districts. Formerly, the recruiting-sergeant used to clinch
the bargain with the would-be recruit by presenting him with a
shilling, on which the recruit usually got drunk. The âQueenâs
Shillingâ has, however, been done away with, and the recruit has now to
get drunk at his own expense.</p>

<p>After going through certain formalities and answering certain
questions before a magistrate, the recruit signs his
âattestation-paper,â and is then considered as enlisted.</p>

<p>The terms of service are, as a rule, seven years with the colours
and five years thereafter in the Reserve. There are a few exceptions to
this; men joining the Household Cavalry, Colonial Corps,<a
id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"
class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and one or two other smaller branches of the
Service, enlist for twelve years with the colours; men for the Royal
Engineers or Foot Guards have the alternative of the usual term, or
three years with the colours and nine years in the Reserve; whilst the
Army Service Corps and Medical Staff Corps men and a few others serve
for only three years with the colours and a varying term of years in
the Reserve.</p>

<p>Recruits, at the date of their enlistment, must have the physical
equivalent of 19 years of age, must be at least
5&nbsp;ft.&nbsp;4&nbsp;in. high, and must have a minimum
chest-measurement of 33 inches.<a id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<p>Re-engagements up to seven or twelve years with the colours are
permitted in most, and up to twenty-one years in special, cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sketch of the History of Our Army.</div>

<p class="sind">At a very early period of English history every able-bodied man was
bound to take up arms in the event of a civil war or invasion. He was,
however, only liable to serve in his own county. This force thus formed
was called the General Levy.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages the feudal system was in force, <i>i.e.</i>,
the retainers, tenants, and vassals of every knight were required to
attend their master if he went to fight abroad. The knights in their
turn were bound to attend the king when <i>he</i> went to fight abroad,
and thus a very respectable army was formed for the time being. This
army, <i>i.e.</i>, the knights and their followers, was called the
Feudal Levy. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, members of the
General Levy were told off for the service and defence of the Crown.
They were trained and exercised in the profession of arms, and received
the name of Trained Bands. The Honourable Artillery Company, a similar
force, was raised about this time. The Sovereign could, if necessary,
hire additional mercenary soldiers to assist him in war, and these were
paid by Parliament. The Civil War, however, in Charles I.âs reign,
upset the general military system, and for some time there was no
National Army.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="fig004">
<img class="smallbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig004.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Officer, 5th (Northumberland)<br />Fusiliers.</p>
</div>

<p>On the Restoration, in 1660, considerable changes and improvements
took place. The Feudal Levy was abolished, the General Levy became the
Militia, and the foundations were laid of the present Standing
Army.</p>

<p>It may be news to some people that the âraising or keeping a
standing army within the kingdom in time of peace is against law,â but
such is the fact. Parliament has every year to specially notify its
consent to a standing army; otherwise the Army would cease to
exist.</p>

<p>Since Charles II.âs time, the Standing Army has gradually been
increasing and improving. Voluntary enlistment dates from his reign,
but it apparently has not always been sufficiently productive of men,
for we find in the last century that debtors and criminals were obliged
to serve in the ranks, in order to keep the Army up to strength. The
pressgang was also in force till 1780. It is hardly astonishing then
that some, nay, a great many, ill-educated people have been taught, by
means of traditions handed down from their great-grandfathers, to look
upon the Army as a sink of iniquity, and that they still hold
extraordinary and utterly unreasonable views on the subject. They need
be under no apprehension about letting their sons and relations enlist.
The Army is now composed of a very good class of men, drawn chiefly
from the labouring and <i>not</i> from the criminal classes (as some
people seem to imagine). The proportion of educated recruits is rapidly
increasing, a better class of men is now enlisting, and the military
crime of to-day is absurdly small as compared with that of twenty years
ago, and is still decreasing.</p>

<p>The British Cavalry is the smartest in the world. In the Cavalry of
nearly all foreign armies, Germany for instance, and France, the horses
are trained to a degree that is unheard of in the English arm; thus
their men require but little skill in riding, and may be described as
good soldiers on horseback. Ours, on the contrary, are born horsemen,
and do not need to have their horses so thoroughly trained. The
consequence is that when our men find themselves in a predicament not
provided for by the Regulations, their natural qualities stand them in
good stead, and by their brilliant riding and dash they turn to good
account a situation which might otherwise offer serious difficulties.
The British Cavalry is divided into Heavy, Medium, and Light, according
to the size and weight of the men. The Household Cavalry, 1st and 2nd
Dragoons, are heavy, and are never quartered abroad, the Hussars are
light, and all the rest are medium Cavalry.</p>

<p class="caption1">Sergeant-Drummer,<br />Coldstream Guards.</p>
</div>

<p>The Life Guards, Dragoon Guards (except the 6th), Dragoons, and 16th
Lancers wear scarlet, the remainder of the Cavalry dark blue,
tunics.</p>

<p>The Life Guards and Blues are the only regiments who wear cuirasses,
and these they would probably leave behind on active service. They, the
Dragoon Guards and the Dragoons (except the 2nd Scots Greys, who wear
bearskins), wear steel or brass helmets, with plumes varying in colour
according to the regiment. The Lancers wear the well-known Lancer cap,
with the scarlet<a id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
âplastronâ in front of their tunics. The Hussars wear the busby, with
busby-bag and plume of different colours according to the regiment; and
they have also six rows of yellow braid across the front of the tunic.
All the Cavalry wear dark blue pantaloons<a id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
or overalls, with red, white, or yellow stripes, and the Household
Cavalry has in addition white leather breeches and jackboots for full
dress. The Cavalry forage-cap is a small round one, and always worn over
the right ear.</p>

<p>Their arms are sword and carbine throughout; the Lancer regiments in
addition carry the lance of male bamboo, and with a red and white
pennon. The Cavalry carbine is of the Martini-Henry pattern, with a
bore of Â·450 in.; it is sighted up to 1,000 yds., and is a first-rate
little weapon.</p>

<p>Of these patterns, the 12-pounder alone is a breech-loader; the
others are muzzle-loaders.</p>

<p>The 12-pounder is being issued as fast as possible to all R. H. A.
batteries. The F. A. will be divided into Light and Heavy Field
Artillery, the former of which will receive the 12-pounder B.-L. gun,
and the latter a new pattern 20-pounder B.-L. gun, with 8 horses to a
team. When this is done, the R. H. A. will probably receive a new
10-pounder B.-L. gun.</p>

<p>2 guns and wagons together are called a Section; 1 gun and wagon, a
Sub-division.</p>

<p>A Garrison Battery is variously constituted, according to its
locality. The men of the battery have to work guns of all sorts and
sizes in the different forts where they are quartered, and, as a rule,
have no guns of their own.</p>

<p>Of the 96 Garrison Batteries, 4 are Siege-train batteries, quartered
in the United Kingdom, and armed with heavy guns for battering
purposes, and 4 more are âHeavyâ batteries, quartered in India, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
guns of which are drawn by elephants and the wagons by bullocks.</p>

<p>The Garrison Artillery is grouped in 3 divisions: the Eastern (29
batteries), Southern (42), and Western (25). Although these divisions
are by way of corresponding with the different points of the compass in
Great Britain, the batteries composing them are scattered in every
quarter of the globe, and the Militia Brigades attached are not
necessarily Eastern, Southern, and Western ones.</p>

<p>The Mountain Artillery is armed with 2&frac12;-inch 7-pounder jointed
guns, each gun and gun-carriage being carried in pieces on 5 mules. One
battery is in England (Newport), one in South Africa, and the rest in
India.</p>

<p>The Royal Malta Artillery is for the defence of that island, and is
composed of Maltese officers and men.</p>

<p class="skip1">Men of the Horse Artillery are dressed in dark-blue Hussar-like
jackets, and busbies with a white plume and scarlet busby-bag; the
remainder of the Artillery in dark-blue tunics with red facings, and
black felt helmets with a brass ball instead of a spike. They are armed
with Martini-Henry carbines, and either sword or sword-bayonet,
according to their branch of the arm. The forage-cap is a small, round,
brimless one, with a band of orange braid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Engineers.</div>

<p class="sind">The corps of Royal Engineers is divided into a
number of battalions, depÃ´ts, and other units, which are given below as
far as possible. As will be seen, their duties, and especially those of
the officers, are extremely various.</p>

<p>The officers are employed sometimes with their men and sometimes
apart from them. A large number of R. E. officers (between 350 and 400)
serve in India, in connection with Native Engineer troops; others are
employed either at home or in a colony on staff work, public works,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Military Schools, the Ordnance Survey, military telegraphy and
railways, Engineer Militia and Volunteers, and a host of other duties
too numerous to mention. In fact, the Engineers form the Scientific
Corps of the Army. The officers are trained in the R. M. Academy at
Woolwich, and the rank and file are nearly all well-educated men,
skilled mechanics and trained workmen forming the bulk of them. That
their work does not interfere with their worth as soldiers has been
shown on many a field, and individual instances of their gallantry are
numerous.</p>

<p>Formerly the Corps was composed of a large number (about 40) of
independent companies, split up and quartered throughout the Empire.
Now they have been collated together and formed into different
battalions and other units, according to their work.</p>

<p>The Corps is now composed as follows:â</p>

<p>(a.) A Bridging Battalion, consisting of 2 pontoon troops, each
troop numbering 5 officers, 28 N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs, and 183 men, with 20
pontoon- and 8 other wagons, and 190 horses. Each troop carries the
material for 120 yards of pontoon-bridge.</p>

<p>(b.) 2 Field Battalions, each of 4 companies. The companies however
still preserve their independence to a great extent, being quartered in
widely divergent localities, according to requirements.</p>

<p>The 1st Battalion consists of the former Nos. 7, 11, 17, and 23
independent companies, and the 2nd of Nos. 12, 26, 37, and 38.</p>

<p>A Field Company consists of 7 officers, 26 N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs, 184 sappers,
etc., 70 horses, and 13 vehicles.</p>

<p>A proportion of the company, from one-fifth to one-third, is
mounted.</p>

<p>These companies, as their name implies, are employed in digging,
sapping, making field-works, and blowing up places, on active
service.</p>

<p>(c.) A Telegraph Battalion of 2 divisions (in war, of 4 sections),
the whole consisting of 6 officers, 15 N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs, 224 men, 171 horses,
and 22 vehicles. Their duties consist in laying lines of field
telegraphs, and making themselves generally useful in their branch of
science wherever they may happen to be.</p>

<p>(d.) A Submarine Mining Battalion, consisting of one depÃ´t and 11
service companies (the old Nos. 4, 21, 22, 27, 28, 30, 33, 34, 35, 39,
and 40), numbering about 760 of all ranks. Their strength varies
according to the locality in which they are employed.</p>

<p>(e.) A Coast Battalion of 3 divisions, altogether about 240 of all
ranks, employed in defensive works on the sea-coast.</p>

<p>(f.) 4 Survey Companies (Nos. 13, 14, 16, and 19), 330 men in all,
engaged in the Ordnance and other official Surveys.</p>

<p>(g.) 17 Fortress Companies, of varying strengths (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5,
6, 9, 15, 18, 20, 24, 25, 29, 31, 32, 36, 41, and 42), which are
employed in the repair and keeping up of fortresses. In war-time they
would design and execute siege-batteries, parallels, and all work
connected with either the attack or defence of fortresses. In
peace-time they number altogether about 1600 men.</p>

<p>(h.) 8 DepÃ´t Companies, which are employed in the training and
drilling of recruits, and in work relating to the Corps. They number
820 men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>(i.) 2 Railway Companies (Nos. 8 and 10), which number 140 men
together, and would be employed in the laying and repairing of railway
lines on service.</p>

<p>(k.) A Supernumerary Staff of nearly 400 men, which is employed in a
great variety of duties too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>420 more men are distributed in different parts of the world and in
military schools of different sorts.</p>

<p>The grand total of Royal Engineers in peace-time is therefore about
7,300 men.</p>

<p class="skip1">Officers and men are dressed, armed, and equipped
very similarly to the Infantry of the Line (q. v.). They may, however,
be readily distinguished by the broad red stripe on their trousers, and
by the Royal Arms in front of the helmet. The forage-caps of the
rank-and-file are small round ones with a broad yellow band and no
brim, worn on the top of the head. Officers wear a black and gold pouch
belt instead of a sash. The facings are of dark-blue velvet, with
yellow edging.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Infantry.</div>

<p class="sind">The British Infantry is composed ofâ</p>

<ul class="nobullet">
  <li>The Brigade of Guards (3 regiments).</li>
  <li>69 Regiments of Infantry of the Line.</li>
  <li>1 West India Regiment.</li>
</ul>

<p>Napoleon the Great said of the British Infantry: âIt is the best
infantry in the world; luckily, there is not much of it.â It has
certainly not deteriorated since his day; but, unfortunately, it is not
much more numerous now than it was then.</p>

<p>Two years ago a distinguished Russian general said to an English
Guardsman: âAre your men as fine a lot as they were in â54?â and on
receiving an answer in the affirmative, said: âI am sorry for it, if we
ever have to fight you again. I had more than enough of them in the
Crimea.â And Moltke said of the late Nile Expedition in 1885: âNo one
but English soldiers could have done what they did.â</p>

<p>Such remarks speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The Brigade of Guards consists of three
regimentsâ</p>

<ul class="nobullet">
  <li>The Grenadier Guards, of which there are 3 battalions.</li>
  <li>The Coldstream Guards, of which there are 2 battalions.</li>
  <li>The Scots Guards, of which there are 2 battalions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These three regiments form the Sovereignâs Body-Guard, and do not
usually serve out of Europe. The late campaigns in Egypt, however (1882
and 1885), and the prospective campaign in Canada in 1864, in all of
which two or more battalions of Guards took part, go to prove that
every rule has its exceptions.</p>

<p>At home, usually five battalions are quartered in London, and the
other two in Windsor and Dublin respectively.</p>

<p>The uniform of the Guards differs from that of the Infantry of the
Line chiefly in the shape of the facings and in the head-gear, the
latter being the well-known bearskin, with white or red plumes for
Grenadiers or Coldstream respectively. The forage-cap is round, with
bands of red, white, and dice for the three regiments respectively. The
armament and equipment is precisely that of the Infantry of the
Line.</p>

<p>Of the 69 Regiments of the Line, one
(Cameron Highlanders) consists of 1
battalion; two (60th Kingâs Royal Rifle
Corps and Rifle Brigade) of 4 battalions;
and the remainder of 2 battalions each.
Total 141 battalions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiments are now called after their âTerritorial Districts,â
which are the districts whence their recruits are drawn, and in which
their depÃ´t is situated. Up to 1881, the Infantry of the Line consisted
of 109 regiments, mostly of 1 battalion each, and numbered up to 109.
In that year, however, the system was changed, and a regiment is now
known by the county or part of the country it recruits in, with
occasionally the addition of a few other titles, such as âBorderers,â
âKingâs Own,â âLoyal,â etc., etc.</p>

<p>The Infantry, with the exception of the four Rifle regiments, is, of
course, clothed in scarlet tunics, with facings of dark blue, white,
yellow, or green, according as whether the regiment is a âRoyal,â
English, Scottish, or Irish one.</p>

<p>The head-dress of the Fusiliers is a busby of rough sealskin, shaped
similarly to the Guardsâ bearskin, but much smaller. The (5th)
Northumberland Fusiliers wear a red and white plume, the remainder
none.</p>

<p>The Rifle regiments are clothed in a very dark green, almost black,
uniform. The Rifle Brigade facings are black, those of the 60th K. R.
R. red, and those of the other two, Scottish and Irish Rifles, dark and
light green respectively. The first two mentioned are historically
connected with Hussar regiments,<a id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
and consequently the officers wear round forage-caps, trailing swords,
and a few other Cavalry-like details; and the late head-gear used to be
a Hussar-like black busby. The helmet of all Rifle regiments is at
present black, but it will shortly be exchanged for a black Astrakhan
fatigue-cap, with plume for full dress.</p>

<p>The five Highland regiments are the Black Watch (Royal Highlanders),
the Seaforth, the Gordon, the Cameron, and the Argyll-and-Sutherland
Highlanders. They wear the feather-bonnet and well-known Highland
dressâplaid, kilt, hose, white gaiters, and shoes. The tartan, sporran,
hose, and a few other details differ in the various regiments.</p>

<p class="caption1">Officer, 6th Dragoon Guards<br />(Carbineers).</p>
</div>

<p>The remainder of the Infantry, whether Light Infantry or not, wear<a
id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9"
class="fnanchor">[9]</a> black felt helmets with brass spike and
fixings, the scarlet tunic aforesaid, and blue-black trousers. Their
forage-cap is the âGlengarry.â</p>

<p>The West India Regiment consists of two battalions of negroes,
officered by Englishmen. The battalions are quartered, turn and turn
about, in the West Indies and in our possessions on the West Coast of
Africa. The men are dressed in white jackets, with a red vest over
them, loose blue Zouave knickerbockers, and yellow gaiters. The
head-dress is a turban.</p>

<p>The Infantry, whose weapon for the last seventeen years has been the
Martini-Henry rifle, will very shortly be all armed with the new
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
magazine rifle, which has already been issued to a considerable number.
The action is on the breech-loading bolt system; by it cartridges may
be fired either singly or by means of the magazine, which is a black
tin box, holding eight cartridges, and suspended immediately in front
of the trigger-guard. The bore is extremely small, being only Â·303
inches. The bullet is coated with a hard metal composition, for if it
were of lead, it would âstripâ in the grooves of the barrel, and by
degrees choke it up. The powder is as yet not definitely fixed on,
though numerous varieties have been tried with great success. It shoots
point blank up to 300 yards, and is sighted on the back sight up to
2,000 yards. By a hanging foresight arrangement, it can be sighted up
to 3,500 yardsânearly two miles! The cartridges are so small and light
that more than twice the amount of ammunition can now be carried than
was possible in the case of the late weapon.</p>

<p>The new bayonet is a much shorter implement than the late one,
looking more like a large knife than a bayonet. The name of the new
rifle is the Burton-Lee.</p>

<p>The equipment consists of a valise and canteen, suspended by leather
braces to the belt, a havresack, wooden water-bottle, and bayonet-frog.
Inside the valise is carried the great-coat (under the valise flap),
and such articles as are necessary for the time being, such as boots,
shirt, socks, hold-all, etc.</p>

<p>A new equipment, slightly different from the above, is now being
issued.</p>

<p>Two pouches are attached to the belt in front, holding twenty rounds
Martini-Henry ammunition each. Thirty more rounds are carried in the
valise and havresack, making seventy in all. With the
new rifle cartridges, however, and new pouches, it is expected that
each man will be able to carry 150 rounds.</p>

<p class="skip1">A battalion of Infantry is composed of 8 companies, each company
numbering 3 officers, 10 N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs, and 111 men on a field
establishment. In peace-time, the company rarely numbers above 90 men
all told, except in India. The battalion consists therefore ofâ</p>

<p class="hang1">&ensp;30 officers (1 lieut.-colonel, 4
majors, 5 captains, 16 subalterns, etc., etc.),</p>

<p class="hang1">&ensp;91 N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs,</p>

<p class="hang1">975 men,</p>

<p class="hang1">&ensp;70 horses,</p>

<p class="hang1 skip1">&ensp;16 carts.</p>

<p>These horses and carts belong for the most part to the Regimental
Transport, which has been issued to each battalion forming part of the
1st Army Corps (of which more hereafter).</p>

<p>An Infantry Brigade consists of four battalions and details, and
numbers in war-time 130 officers, 4,350 men, and 530 horses.</p>

<p>An Infantry Division consists of 2 brigades, 3 batteries Field
Artillery, 1 squadron of Cavalry and detailsâtotal, 327 officers,
10,060 men, and 2000 horses.</p>

<p>An Army Corps is to consist of 3 Divisions of Infantry, 3 Horse
Artillery, and 2 Field Artillery batteries, Royal Engineers, Cavalry
squadron and detailsâtotal, 1,158 officers, 35,000 men, and 10,000
horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Medical Staff Corps.</div>

<p class="sind">The Medical Staff Corps consists of 17
Divisions, distributed throughout Great Britain and Ireland, and
numbering altogether about 400 medical officers and 2,000 N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs
and men. The depÃ´t and training-school is at Aldershot, and the Army
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Medical School at Netley. This Corps does not include the Indian
Medical Staff Corps.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Army Service Corps.</div>

<p class="sind">The Army Service Corps corresponds to the
former Commissariat and Transport Corps, and deals with the issue of
rations and general transport duty. It is divided into 37 companies,
distributed throughout Great Britain and Ireland, and numbering 230
officers, 3,363 N.C.O.âs and men, and 1,300 horses and mules.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chaplainsâ Depart&shy;ment.</div>

<p class="sind">The Chaplainsâ Department consists of about 80
chaplains, divided into four classes. There are four official
denominations allowed, Church of England, Roman Catholic,
Presbyterians, and Wesleyans. Men belonging to any other of the
numerous sects of religion prevalent in England are officially entered
as âChurch of England.â</p>

<p class="skip1">The organisation of the remaining departments,
<i>i.e.</i>, Ordnance Store, Veterinary, and Pay, is uninteresting, and
need not be detailed here.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military Districts.</div>

<p class="sind">Of the Regular Forces, 21 regiments of
Cavalry, 91 batteries of Artillery, most of the Engineers, and 73
battalions of Infantry are quartered in Great Britain and Ireland.
Great Britain is divided into 11, Ireland into 3, and the Channel
Islands into 2, Districts, each under the command of a major-general.
These districts are sub-divided into Regimental Districts, each of
these latter comprising the recruiting ground, depÃ´t, and Volunteer
battalions of a Territorial (<i>i.e.</i>, Line Infantry) Regiment of
two Regular and two or more Militia battalions. The Artillery and
Engineers, both Regular, Militia, and Volunteer, are also apportioned
to each district. The Regular Corps of all arms rarely remain more than
two years in the same quarters, changing from station to station in
accordance with different rosters and requirements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Foreign Service.</div>

<p class="sind">The whole of the Regular Forces, with the exception
of the five Heavy Cavalry regiments and Brigade of Guards, take their
turn at foreign service in India and the Colonies. As a rule, one
battalion of each regiment of the Line is abroad for sixteen years, and
is âfedâ with men from the other battalion at home. This system, by
which all the best and soundest men of a regiment are sent abroad, can
hardly be called a good one, but it is difficult to suggest another.
For foreign service it is no use having the youngest and unmatured
soldiersâthey would probably only fall sick in a hot climate. It is,
therefore, necessary to keep and train the men till they know their
duty thoroughly, and then send them out as full-grown men. It is for
this reason that complaints are so often seen in the newspapers that
certain regiments are apparently composed of âbeardless boys.â This may
be so with the home battalion, but if the complaint-makers were to
journey to the Colonies and see the other battalion, they would soon
alter their opinion.</p>

<p>It sometimes occurs that both battalions are abroad together, in
which case the depÃ´t of the regiment is largely increased; in order to
feed the two.</p>

<p>Cavalry regiments stay abroad from twelve to fifteen years, and are
fed by their depÃ´t.</p>

<p>This foreign service is one of the main impediments in the way of
recruiting by conscription.</p>

<p class="skip1">Of the Regular Forces abroad, 9 Cavalry regiments, 88
batteries of Artillery, 3 companies R. E., and 53 battalions of
Infantry are in India; and 1 Cavalry regiment, 27 batteries Artillery,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
13 companies R.  E., and 20 battalions of Infantry are in the
Colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Marines.</div>

<p class="sind">The Royal Marines, although not coming strictly
under the head of the Army, are yet soldiers in the widest sense of the
word, for they have been engaged by land and sea in every single
campaign since their formation in 1755. They consist of two divisions,
<i>i.e.</i> Artillery (16 companies) and Light Infantry (48 companies),
in all nearly 14,000 men. They enlist for twelve yearsâ service, and
may re-engage for nine years more. In garrison they perform the same
duties as the Regular army, and on board ship work of a military
character, such as guard mounting, working big guns, forming part of
armed force on boat service, or fighting on shore under all sorts of
conditions and in all climates. The latest development of the Marine is
not a Horse-, but a Camel-Marine, a force of Marines having served up
the Nile with the Camel Corps.</p>

<p>The Marines have done well wherever they have been, and still form,
chiefly no doubt owing to their long service, some of our steadiest
troops on service.</p>

<p>Their uniform and equipment is very similar to those of the
corresponding branches of the Regular Army. A Marine may always be told
from a Linesman by the badge on his helmet and shoulder-strapsâa globe
with the thoroughly apposite motto of âPer Mare, per Terram.â</p>

<div class="sidenote">Native Indian Army.</div>

<p class="sind">The Native Indian Army is composed of Native
Cavalry, Artillery, Engineers, Infantry, Medical Corps, etc., etc.,
partly officered by Englishmen, and numbering altogether about 152,000
men, including 13,000 Volunteers.</p>

<p class="skip1">It is divided into the Armies of the Bengal, Madras,
and Bombay Presidencies.  The English officers are drawn from the

<p>Natives enlist for any period of service, from three years to
thirty. Most of the troops enlist for nine or fifteen years. They
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
must be physically fit and physically equivalent to a full-grown man.
They are for the most part very keen soldiers, especially those that
come from the North-West Provinces and Punjab. In many regiments the
men have to find everything except firearmsâeven horses, accoutrements,
and food, on their pay of about eighteenpence a day; and yet in some
popular regiments there are several hundred candidates waiting for
admission.</p>

<p>The Infantry is armed and equipped similarly to the British
Infantry. Their rifle is of the Snider pattern, and is being exchanged
for the Martini-Henry rifle. The uniforms of the Indian Army are very
variegated, ranging from scarlet to yellow, and drab to green. The
usual head-dress is the turban, but the other details of costume vary
too much for description. The English officers wear in some regiments
the native uniform, in others an English one.</p>

<p>A Native Cavalry regiment consists of 4 squadrons of 2 troops each,
with an establishment of 10 English officers, Native officers, N. C.
O.âs, and about 540 privates.</p>

<p>A Native Infantry Regiment consists of 1 battalion of 8 companies,
with an establishment of 9 English officers, Native officers, N. C.
O.âs, and about 820 privates. Each Infantry regiment is linked with two
others, one of them supplying the other two with men, etc., in time of
war.</p>

<p>The establishment of the Mountain Batteries varies according to
locality.</p>

<p>A Native Reserve is being formed, but is not yet completely
organised.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">Colonial Forces.</div>

<p class="sind">The Colonial Forces consist of those raised by each
Colony of the British Empire for its own protection. With the exception
of a few of the smaller islands in the West Indies and Pacific, it may
be said that every one of our Colonies has trained a certain number of
men for home defence.</p>

<p>The system of enlistment and service varies in almost every colony,
according to requirements. In very few of them are there permanent
forces under arms. They mostly correspond to our Militia, and are
called out for an annual training only.</p>

<p>Of the above troops, a very small number are permanent troops; the
remainder consist of Militia, called out for about twelve daysâ

Militia Reserve for all men between 18 and 60, so that in case of war
the armed levy of the country would amount to over 600,000 men! Not

<p class="skip1">Let us now turn to the Reserve Forces at home,
composed of the two classes of Army Reserves, Militia, Militia Reserve,
Yeomanry, and Volunteers. We will not take into account either the
Native Indian Reserves, as they are not yet fully formed, or the
Colonial Militia or Reserves, as they are inextricably mixed up with
the Colonial Forces already described.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Army Reserve.</div>

<p class="sind">The 1st Class Army Reserve, created in 1877,
consists of men who have served their three, seven, or eight years with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the Colours, and who then pass to this Reserve to complete their
service to twelve years. They are liable to service at home and abroad
when called out; this would happen only in case of war or national
danger. The men would then either join their own regiments or be formed
into separate corps, or, with their consent, be attached to a regiment
or corps other than their old one. This class numbers over 54,000
men.</p>

<p class="skip1">The 2nd Class Army Reserve, in which there are not
quite 3,000 men, is composed of those men who have served twelve years
with the Colours and then choose to enter this Reserve, and of a few
other special classes of men. They do not serve out of Great Britain.
Both classes are liable to be called out for an annual training, but
have never yet been so called out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Militia.</div>

<p class="sind">The Militia consists of men voluntarily enlisted
for six years, with power to re-engage for periods of four years up to
forty-five years of age. The recruits are trained for six months or
less at the depÃ´t of the regimental district, and have subsequently to
undergo only twenty-eight daysâ<a id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10"
class="fnanchor">[10]</a> training a year with their corps when called
out. During these twenty-eight days the men receive regular pay, with
a âbountyâ of 10<i>s.</i> or upward at the end of the training. They
are then dismissed till next year.</p>

<p>In cases of national emergency, the Militia may be called out,
<i>i.e.</i> âembodied,â for active service. This has occurred four
times already in this century; during the Crimean War, for instance,
ten battalions of Militia were garrisoning our possessions in the
Mediterranean, and no fewer than 32,000 entered the Regulars and fought
before Sebastopol.</p>

<p>The Militia comprises Artillery, Engineers, and Infantry.</p>

<p>The Artillery consists of 34 brigades of Garrison Artillery,
attached to the regular Garrison Artillery Divisions as follows:â4 to
the Eastern, 21 to the Southern, and 9 to the Western Division. The
Engineer Militia numbers 7 companies.</p>

<p>The Infantry consists of 131 battalions, attached to the different
regiments of Infantry of the Line as their 3rd and 4th or other
battalions, and belonging to the same regimental districts. Some
regiments have only one Militia battalion attached, others as many as
five.</p>

<p>The Militia is clothed, equipped, and armed identically with the
Regular Army, the only distinction being that a Militia private wears
the number of his battalion, and a Militia officer the letter M in
addition on his shoulder-straps.</p>

<p>The Channel Islands have 4 regiments of Artillery, and 6 of Infantry
Militia. Malta has 1 regiment of the latter.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Militia numbers altogether 103,500 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Militia Reserve.</div>

<p class="sind">The Militia Reserve consists of men enlisted from
the Militia for six years or for the remainder of their Militia
engagements. These are liable to an annual training, or to embodiment
in case of national danger. The body was created in 1867 as a temporary
expedient for an Army Reserve, the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 having
caused extreme uneasiness to our authorities; for they discovered then
that we had absolutely no reserves whatever, in case we went to war.
The inducement to join is a pecuniary one, <i>i.e.</i> Â£1 bounty, paid
in advance, for every year service in the Militia. It numbers
altogether 30,160 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yeomanry.</div>

<p class="sind">The Yeomanry is composed of 39 county regiments of Cavalry, and
forms a species of Cavalry Militia or Volunteers. They are called out
annually for only one weekâs training. They are liable to be called out,
in addition, for service in any part of Great Britain in case of
threatened invasion, or to suppress a riot. They receive allowances and
pay during their training, an allowance for clothing, and their arms,
from the Government; but have to find their own horses. There is no
Yeomanry in Ireland.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Yeomanry numbered, in 1889, 10,739 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Volunteers.</div>

<p class="sind">The Volunteers consist of a large number of Corps, both Artillery,
Engineers, Infantry, and Medical Staff Corps, with 2 Corps of Light
Horse and 1 of Mounted Rifles. The Honourable Artillery Company
(composed of 1 battery Field Artillery, 6 troops Light Cavalry, and 8
companies Infantry), although not strictly Volunteers, may be
considered as coming under this head.</p>

<p>The Artillery Volunteers are divided into 9 Divisions according to
their locality, forming 62 Corps.</p>

<p>The Engineer Volunteers form 16 Corps of Engineers, 9 Divisions
Submarine Miners, and 1 Railway Staff-Corps.</p>

<p>The Infantry comprises no less than 211 battalions, distributed
throughout Great Britain, and attached to the different regular
regimental districts. 31 Infantry Volunteer Brigades have now been
formed, each consisting of five or more battalions, and each commanded
by a colonel of Auxiliary Forces.</p>

<p>The number of Volunteers is unlimited, and has gone on steadily
increasing, since their formation in 1859. The Corps were
originally intended to be self-supporting, finding themselves in
everything except arms. Now, however, the Government, having awoke to
their importance as a great national reserve for home defence, gives a
Capitation Grant of 35<i>s.</i> a year to the different Corps for every
efficient Volunteer on their lists, and Â£2 10<i>s.</i> more for every
officer and sergeant who obtains a certificate of proficiency.</p>

<p>Volunteers are liable to be called out for active military service
in Great Britain, in case of a threatened invasion.</p>

<p>It is, however, a fact that, if they chose, the Volunteers might, on
the eve of the invasion, all disappear within fourteen days by simply
giving notice of their wish to retire! A little legislation on this
point might not be out of place, though of course such a catastrophe is
not to be dreamt of.</p>

<p>Volunteers are exempt from service in the Militia, and cannot be
employed as a military body in aid of the Civil Power. They receive no
pay, and have to attend a certain number of drills of different sorts
every year, otherwise they are not considered efficient.</p>

<p>The Volunteers are not yet thoroughly equipped for service, but
strenuous efforts are being made in this direction by private and
public enterprise.</p>

<p>Their uniforms vary greatly in colour, from green or scarlet to drab
or grey, and in appearance. It is, however, expected that all Corps
will in time present a similar appearance to the Regular Forces, with
the main distinction of silver or white-metal embroidery and buttons
instead of the gold or brass of the Regulars.</p>

<p>The rifle of the Volunteers is either the Martini-Henry or the
Snider.</p>

<p>The organisation of the Volunteer Corps
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
is identical with that of the corresponding Regular Forces.</p>

<p class="skip1">There were on the 1st January, 1890, 216,999 efficient
Volunteers, besides 7,022 non-efficientsâtotal 224,021.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Entrance Of Officers.</div>

<p class="sind">The mode of entrance of officers to the Regular
Army is as follows:âThe candidate, if wishing to enter the Cavalry or
Infantry has two routes open to him. He may either pass a competitive
âpreliminaryâ and âfurtherâ examination for the Royal Military College,
Sandhurst, remain there one year, and then enter his regiment direct
(if successful in passing the âfinalâ examination), or else he may be
appointed as 2nd lieutenant to a Militia battalion, undergo two annual
trainings, and then pass an examination equivalent to the Sandhurst
âfinal.â Formerly this latter mode of entrance, <i>i.e.</i> through the
Militia, was considered much the easiest, but now there is not much to
choose between the two.</p>

<p class="skip1">A candidate for the Artillery or Engineers has to pass two
examinations in the R. M. Academy, Woolwich, and then spend two years
there. The order of merit in which the cadets pass the âfinalâ
determines which branch they are to join. As a rule, those passing out
high up join the Engineers, and the others the Artillery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military Establish&shy;ments.</div>

<p class="sind">Other Military establishments are:â</p>

<p>(a.) The Staff College near Sandhurst, which an officer may enter by
means of a competitive examination, after he has served five years at
least with his regiment. Here he remains for two years, and is
instructed in the various acquirements necessary for a good Staff
officer, and in the higher branches of his profession. Having passed
the final examination, the officer is attached for two months each to
the two branches of the service other than that which he belongs to,
and then rejoins his own regiment; he is then entitled to put p.s.c.
after his name in the Army List.</p>

<p>(b.) School of Gunnery at Shoeburyness, where experiments are
carried out and new inventions in gunnery tried, etc., etc.</p>

<p>(c.) Artillery College at Woolwich.âInstruction, etc., in the higher
branches of gunnery.</p>

<p>(d.) School of Military Engineering at Chatham, where officers and
N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs of different Corps are put through a course, experiments in
engineering tried, etc., etc.</p>

<p>(e.) School of Musketry at Hythe, for instruction of officers and N.
C. O.âs in the use of, and in details and experiments concerning, small
arms.</p>

<p class="skip1">(f.) Schools of Gymnasium and Signalling at Aldershot, the Army
Medical School at Netley, the Veterinary School at Aldershot, and the
School of Music at Hounslow, whose titles sufficiently explain their
<i>raison dâÃªtre</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mounted Infantry, &amp;c.</div>

<p class="sind">A glance at the latest accessories to the Army in
the shape of Mounted Infantry, Machine-guns, and Cyclists, may not be
out of place here.</p>

<p>The authorities consider that a force of Mounted Infantry
(<i>i.e.</i>, Infantry with rifles on horseback) will be of the
greatest use to the Army in case of war. Accordingly, a force is being
trained, little by little, which would be available to act as such on
active service.</p>

<p>For the past two or three years 2 companies at Aldershot, formed of
volunteers from the different Infantry battalions quartered there, and
1 company at the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Curragh, consisting of 150 men each, have been trained during the
winter months to act as Mounted Infantry. On the conclusion of the
course, the men are sent back to their regiments, and a fresh lot come
on the following winter. These companies are intended to be formed into
battalions when required. The duty of this force on service will be to
act as Infantry, but with a rapidity of transport from one place to
another unattainable by ordinary Infantry. Thus they may be pushed
forward to attack a village, to hold a defensive position till
supported by other Infantry, to assist the Cavalry, or to perform a
hundred other duties of Infantry far in front of the real Infantry.</p>

<p>It is proposed that every battalion of Infantry and regiment of
Cavalry should in future wars have a Machine-gun Detachment of 2
machine-guns, worked by 1 officer and 12 men, attached to it. A large
number of men have been trained in this work, but there are at this
moment but few complete detachments in existence.</p>

<p class="skip1">Corps of Cyclists, chiefly Volunteer, have also lately
been started, but it seems very questionable whether they would ever be
of any use in a hostile country except to carry messages to and fro
along good roads.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Army Corps.</div>

<p class="sind" >Finally, mention must be made of the recent
apportioning of the British Regular Army into Army Corps. Serious
difficulties have arisen in organising this matter, for, since
regiments are always on the move from point to point at home, or
between home, India, and the Colonies, it is a very difficult task
indeed to arrange so that even one Army Corps should be ready to take
the field at the shortest possible notice. It has, however, been done,
and the 1st Army Corps is an accomplished fact. The 2nd is on the high
road to completion, though as yet it is badly off for horses.</p>

<p>The above gives a tolerably fair idea of the strength and
constitution of the Army of the British Empire. The Navy, it is true,
is still our first line of defence, as it has been for hundreds of
years; but although the best in the world, it is not yet large enough
for our needs. Our Regular Army has also been shown to be barely large
enough. It is, therefore, doubly necessary to keep the Army at a high
pitch of efficiency, and fully supplied with everything needful, in
order that if we ever come into collision with one of the colossal
European powers detailed in the following pages, we shall not be found
wanting.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was in the autumn of
1870, during the Franco-German War, that the preliminary arrangements
were made for the forthcoming consolidation of the German Empire. Up to
that time, Germany consisted of a multitude of States, each with its own
Government and its own Army. The interests of these States, ranging as
they did from kingdoms down to small principalities, were extremely
conflicting, and internal hostility was frequently the result. The one
great aim of King William of Prussia was to see them all united into one
Empire, and defended by one Army. Aided by the genius of Bismarck, the
negotiations were brought to a successful conclusion, and on the 18th
January, 1871, William of Prussia was declared Emperor of Germany with
the title of William I. At the same time the forces of the different
States were combined, and the present German Army is the result.</p>

<p>In peace and war this United Army is under the command of the
Emperor, and each man is bound by oath to render him faithful and loyal
service.</p>

<p class="skip1">Several of the States, whilst keeping their own
troops, have, by means of special military conventions, attached
themselves and their forces still closer to the chief military power of
the Empire, namely, <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Prussia. On the other hand, a few of
the larger States have reserved for themselves a certain independence
in the management of their armies. The chief outward and visible sign
thereof is seen in the variations of uniform from the strict Prussian
pattern. Thus, the Bavarian Infantry has kept its light-blue tunic, the
Saxons still have red piping round their skirts, and the WÃ¼rttembergers
wear double-breasted tunics and grey greatcoats.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Organisa&shy;tion.</div>

<p class="sind">The Army may be roughly divided into four
groups:</p>

<p>1. The combined forces of Prussia and the following States, which
have concluded conventions with her: Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Meiningen,
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Saxe-Altenburg, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, the two
principalities of Reuss, Oldenburg, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Lippe,
Schaumburg-Lippe, LÃ¼beck, Bremen, Hamburg, Waldeck, Brunswick, Grand
Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Grand Duchy
of Baden, and Grand Duchy of Hesse.</p>

<p>2. The Saxon Army Corpsâ(one).</p>

<p>3. The Bavarian Army Corpsâ(two).</p>

<p>4. The WÃ¼rttemberg Army Corpsâ(one).</p>

<p class="skip1">Universal Conscription is the keystone of the Army.
Introduced on September 3rd, 1814, first of all, it was amended by the
law of the 16th April, 1871, and perfected by subsequent laws passed in
1874 and 1881. The recent edict of the 11th February, 1888, has put the
finishing touches to it, so that it now holds sway throughout the whole
Empire. According to this law, every German who is physically capable
and who is in the enjoyment of civil rights, is bound to serve as a
soldier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">A man is bound to commence his service, as a rule,
with his 21st year.</p>

<p>The period of service is as follows:â</p>

<ul class="nobullet">
  <li>3 years with the Colours.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></li>
  <li>4 years in the Reserve of the Active Army.<a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></li>
  <li>5 years in the 1st Class Landwehr.</li>
  <li>7 years in the 2nd Class Landwehr.</li>
  <li>6 years in the 2nd Class Landsturm.</li>
</ul>

<p>By this time the soldier is in his 45th year.</p>

<p>The 1st Class Landwehr is divided into complete units, and these are
formed into Reserve Divisions for the Active Army. The 2nd Class
Landwehr garrisons the interior and fortresses, and acts, if called
out, as a reserve for the above-mentioned Landwehr Reserve
divisions.</p>

<p>All men between the ages of 17 and 45 who are fit to bear arms and
who are not serving in either the Active Army (including the Ersatz
Reserve) or in the Landwehr, are enrolled in the 1st Class Landsturm.
This body can only be called out in case of national invasion, or for
garrison duty at home.</p>

<p>The Ersatz (<i>i.e.</i> Supply) Reserve consists of those men who
are physically fit, but have, owing to surplus numbers or other
causes, escaped being sent to serve in the Regular Army. Part of this
Reserve undergoes a training of ten weeks in the first, six weeks in
the second, and four weeks in the third year. These are considered as
belonging to the so-called âFurlough Menâ<a id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a> class, and serve when required to complete
the Army in the field. On the completion of their thirty-first year,
the men are sent to the Landwehr and 2nd Class Landsturm, and there
they remain till the termination of their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
liability to service, <i>i.e.</i>, their forty-fifth year. The men of
the untrained portion of the Ersatz Reserve remain available for
service up to their thirty-second year, and then pass over to the 1st
and 2nd Classes of the Landsturm in due order.</p>

</div>

<p>If every single able-bodied young man were to be taken for the
Regular Army, two disadvantages would accrue to the State; on the one
hand an immense amount of industrial labour would be lost to the
country, and on the other, it would be impossible for the State to
support such a huge Army. For this reason the law of the constitution
has laid down that the peace Army is not to exceed one per cent. of the
population. This gives the Army the respectable peace-strength of
468,409 men (not including officers and one-year volunteers). Of these
numbers about 156,000 annually enter the ranks as recruits.</p>

<p>There is a supplementary clause to the law of universal
conscription, and that is the one which allows of <i>One-year
Volunteers</i>. It stands to reason that with a three-yearsâ bout of
compulsory service, a large portion of the youth of the country are
interrupted in the studies which are to prepare them for their
particular professions, and that at a period when they can least afford
to lose the time. For the labourer, who needs but little knowledge for
his daily task, and for those handicraftsmen whose work demands but
little brain capacity or culture of any sort, this interruption of
business is of small moment. It is far otherwise, however, with the
young man who requires to spend some time in the higher schools in
order to fit himself for the profession he has chosen, be it industrial
or scientific. This disadvantage of the conscription law makes itself
felt in proportion to the progress in education and general culture
made in the country. At the same time it is obvious that a man who has
the assistance of a well-educated and well-trained mind does not
require so long a period to master the intricacies of soldiering as one
who is less intelligent.</p>

<p class="skip1">For this reason the Government allows young men who
have either received a certificate of educational efficiency from one
of the higher schools or else passed an examination before a commission
appointed for the purpose, to enter the service as volunteers on
completing their seventeenth year. After one year with the Colours they
are sent âon furloughâ to the Active Reserve, and for this privilege
they have to find themselves in uniform, equipment, and food during the
period of their service. They may become officers in the following
manner: If they have behaved well and have subsequently, during two
trainings of several weeks each, whilst attached to a Corps, shown
themselves professionally and socially qualified to become officers,
they are balloted for by the officers of their district. If the ballot
is favourable, they are commissioned by his Majesty and become
full-blown officers of the Reserve. These have, in case of war, to
complete the active establishment of officers to war-strength, or have
to fill vacancies as officers in the Landwehr.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Officers.</div>

<p class="sind">The German Army represents the people under arms,
and their officers represent the cream of the Army. The road to the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
higher, and even to the highest ranks, lies open to every educated man,
without reference to social standing or birth, if
he only have the necessary qualifications thereto.</p>

<p>Every candidate for an officer commission must possessâ</p>

<p>1. A good general education, of which the candidate must give
satisfactory proof, either by the possession of an âAbiturientâ
certificate,<a id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a
href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> or by passing an
examination before a commission held in Berlin.</p>

<p>2. Physical qualifications for military service, including good
eyes.</p>

<p>3. An honourable character.</p>

<p>Having satisfied the authorities on these subjects, the candidate
now serves as a private for five months, generally with the regiment he
intends to enter. At the end of this time, during which he is called an
âavantageur,â he undergoes an examination in military duties, etc., and
on receiving a certificate of satisfactory service from his superior
officers, he becomes an ensign (âPorte-Ã©pÃ©e FÃ¤hnrichâ) and is sent to a
military college for a year. There he passes a final examination in
military knowledge, and, if balloted for successfully by the officers
of the regiment of his choice, he joins as second lieutenant.</p>

     src="images/fig009.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">WÃ¼rttemberg,<br />Sergeant of the Train.</p>
</div>

<p>As much as 40 to 45 per cent. of the officers are drawn from the
Cadet Corps, which is distributed amongst establishments at
Lichterfelde (near Berlin, head college), Kulm, Potsdam, Wahlstatt,
Bensberg, PlÃ¶n and Oranienstein, in Prussia; Dresden in Saxony, and
Munich in Bavaria. A new college will shortly open in Karlsruhe. This
Corps is chiefly composed of the sons of officers, who receive a cheap
and excellent training and education. The proverb that âthe apple falls
close to the stemâ is well exemplified here, for amongst the cadets are
many who bear celebrated soldiersâ names, such as Roon, Steinmetz,
Canstein, etc., etc.</p>

<p>Although the training in the Cadet Corps is chiefly a military one,
yet on the whole the cadets receive an education equal to that of a
first-class civilian college. Thus they are enabled in after-life, when
they have left the Service, to pursue a civilian calling with greater
ease than if their education had been purely military.</p>

<p>Mention may also be made here of the establishments in which the
âPorte-Ã©pÃ©e FÃ¤hnrichsâ (ensigns) are instructed: they are the military
colleges of Potsdam, Engers, Neisse, Glogau, Hanover, Cassel, Anklam,
Metz, and Munich. The higher branches of military science are pursued
in the United Artillery and Engineer School, and the Staff College
(Kriegsakademie), both in Berlin. The entire military education and
training of the country are managed by an Inspection-General.</p>

<p class="skip1">As in all large armies, the three great branches of
the German service are Infantry, Cavalry, and Artillery, besides the
Engineers and Transport Corps, the latter of which is called the
âTrain.â</p>

<div class="sidenote">Infantry.</div>

<p class="sind">As everybody knows, Infantry is intended to go
anywhere and fight anywhere. It is, therefore, equipped for all
contingencies that may arise, and is armed with a weapon for use either
at a long range or in close hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

<p>The German Infantry is<a id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> armed with a capital magazine-rifle, with a
bore of Â·315 inches, which, with a point-blank range of over 300 yards,
will carry up to 2,400 yards.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
The magazine is detachable, and holds 8 cartridges. The bayonet is a
short sword-bayonet, very similar to the new English bayonet.</p>

<p>As a rule, the German foot-soldier has to carry his own equipment,
both on the march and in action. The equipment consists of a knapsack
with large mess-tin attached, great coat, bayonet and scabbard (to
which latter is fastened a small spade), havresack, and water-bottle,
and three pouches, two in front and one behind. These pouches hold,
altogether, 150 rounds. The whole thing can be put on or taken off at a
moment notice, by simply buckling or unbuckling the waist-belt and
slipping the arms into, or out of, the knapsack braces. This new
arrangement also obviates to a great extent the discomfort caused by
the older pattern of equipment, which compressed the man chest
considerably.</p>

<p>The old division of the Infantry into Grenadiers, Musketeers, and
Fusiliers has now no significance, except from a historical point of
view. Nowadays, the whole of the Infantry being identically equipped,
they all receive exactly the same amount of instruction and training,
with the sole exception that the Rifle battalions (JÃ¤ger) spend
somewhat more time and pains on their musketry than the other
troops.</p>

<p>âGrenadiersâ first sprang into existence in the seventeenth century;
as their name indicates, they were originally intended to throw
hand-grenades amongst the enemy ranks. For this object, particularly
powerful men were selected, and in France, under Louis XIV., four
Grenadiers were at first attached to each company; subsequently, each
battalion received a Grenadier company. Grenadiers were now introduced
into every civilised army, but as there was seldom an opportunity for
the employment of their special weapon, they were given muskets, and
remained Grenadiers only in name, and thus the name came to be applied
to particularly fine bodies of troops only. The Prussian Grenadier
battalions of Frederick the Great were the flower of his Army, and in
memory of these troops
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the 1st Prussian Foot-Guard Regiment still wears the old sugar-loaf
brass helmet on big review days and other special occasions. The title
of âGrenadier Regiments,â which the first twelve Prussian Infantry
regiments received in 1861, was only bestowed in order to keep green
the memory of the old Grenadiers.</p>

<p>The names of âMusketeersâ and âFusiliersâ come from the different
firearms their predecessors bore, <i>i.e.</i>, the musket and the rifle
(fusil), first introduced into France in the seventeenth century. The
Musketeers were at first the Heavy Infantry, in contradistinction to
the Fusiliers, who represented the Light Infantry. Later, however, on
each branch receiving the same firearm, the distinction ceased, and it
is now only remembered through the old Fusilier songs, of which there
exist several, and whose burden is the chaffing of the heavy
Musketeer.</p>

<p>The peculiar qualities necessary for good Light Infantry have been
developed <i>par excellence</i> in the Prussian Rifle battalions. These
draw a very large proportion of their recruits from the gamekeepers and
forester class of the country. Such men have of necessity been already
trained in the attainments required for that branch of the Infantry.
They are well acquainted with firearms and can shoot; they can put up
with considerable hardships, they can find their way about a strange
country, and they have studied in the school of natureâin short, they
are the very men to make into skirmishers and marksmen, and are in
their element on outpost or patrol duty. Frederick the Great was the
first to train the JÃ¤ger as Light Infantry, and his influence is seen
to this day. âVive le roi et ses chasseursâ was the motto engraved on
their âhirschfÃ¤ngerâ (lit. âstag-sticker,â a large knife still worn by
keepers for the purpose of giving the stag his <i>coup de grÃ¢ce</i>) in
his day, and it is still the watchword of the Prussian Riflemen of
to-day. Frederick recognised that the true method of employing Riflemen
was to extend them as skirmishers, and there is a story which tells
how, when one day, in Potsdam, the Rifles were marching past him in
close order, the old king shook his crutch-stick at them and shouted:
âGet out of that, get out of that, you scoundrels!â and made them march
past in extended order.</p>

<p>On the 1st of April, 1890, the German Infantry numbered 171
regiments of 3 battalions each, and 21 Rifle battalionsâtotal 534
battalions.</p>

<p class="caption1">WÃ¼rttemberg. Dragoon.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">Cavalry.</div>

<p class="sind">The Cavalry is intended for fighting chiefly at
close quarters and on open ground. Their use on the battle-field is
generally confined to the attack in close order.</p>

<p>Although both branches of the Cavalry, the Heavy and the Light,
receive an identical training, yet the distinction between them has
not yet entirely lost its old significance.  The Cavalry of the German
Army is divided into four groups, distinguished by different equipment
and arms; they are the Cuirassiers, the Dragoons, the Lancers, and the
Hussars. The chief weapon throughout is the sword, though the
Cuirassiers differ from the others in being armed with a long straight
sword, whilst that of the latter is slightly curved.  Besides this
weapon, the whole of the Cavalry is being armed with lances. As it may
happen that the men may have to dismount and use firearms on foot, at
present they are all armed with a useful carbine (Mauser, 1871
pattern); the non-commissioned officers and trumpeters wear a revolver
instead.</p>

<p>The main point in a Cavalry fight is the shock, <i>i.e.</i>, the
moment when they come into contact with the enemy. This must be the
result of gradually quickening the pace till at the supreme moment an
irresistible mass is hurled with crushing force on the ranks of the
enemy. The best powers of man and horse must therefore be reserved for
this moment, and it is a fact that the turning-point of an action has
often been decided by the mere impetus of the charge, and without any
use whatever of cold steel.</p>

<p>Of the whole German Cavalry the Prussian arm has the best
record. This dates from the time of Frederick the Great and his
celebrated Cavalry leaders Zieten, Seydlitz, and others, who made use
of bold and clever offensive tactics which led to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
grand results at Rossbach, Leuthen, Zorndorf, and other
actions. Prussian horses are powerful, fast, and capable of
considerable endurance, so that they are particularly suited to
military service. In addition, the Prussian soldier is a capital
groom. These qualities, in conjunction with thorough discipline and
tactical training, have brought the German Cavalry to a height of
excellence that is surpassed by few.</p>

<p>The Cuirassiers are the troops who from their outward appearance
most resemble the knights of the Middle Ages. Although the cuirass,
from which they take their name, has lately been abolished for field
service in consequence of its weight and inability to keep off the
enemy bullets, yet with the lance, just introduced, a genuine knightly
weapon has been brought in to take its place.</p>

<p>The Prussian Regiment of Gardes-du-Corps, whose chief is
<i>ex-officio</i> the King of Prussia, is equipped and armed in the
same way as the Cuirassiers. Although it forms a Royal body-guard,
still the regiment has seen a considerable amount of service. History
tells of a memorable saying of the Commander of the regiment, Colonel
von Wacknitz, at the battle of Zorndorf (25th August, 1758), where the
enemy, the Russians, were getting the best of the day; Frederick the
Great was with his regiment, the Gardes-du-Corps, and said anxiously
to Colonel von Wacknitz: âWhat do you think of it? My idea is that we
shall get the worst of the action.â
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Von Wacknitz lowered his sword and said: âYour Majesty, no battle is
lost, in my opinion, where the Gardes-du-Corps have not charged.â
âVery good,â said the king, âthen charge.â And the fortune of the day
was decided by the brilliant and successful attack made by this
regiment.  The battle was won, and the country saved.</p>

<p>In Bavaria the two regiments of Heavy Cavalry, and in Saxony the
regiments of Horse Guards and Carbineers, correspond to the Prussian
Cuirassiers.</p>

<p>The Dragoons were originally intended to combine the fire-action of
Infantry with the rapidity of movement of Cavalry, and were therefore
armed, on horseback, with a light musket and bayonet. The Brandenburg
Dragoons of the great Elector Frederick William came greatly to the
fore in this double capacity at the battles of Warsaw and
Fehrbellin. The uncertainty, however, of the results of shooting when
mounted, and the inconvenience of dismounting or mounting according as
to whether the fight raged on foot or on horseback, showed plainly as
time went on that the idea of an intermediate arm, a sort of mounted
infantry, could not yet be brought to perfection. The Dragoons were
therefore, during the eighteenth century, gradually formed into
Cavalry pure and simple, and at the present time they are
horse-soldiers, and horse-soldiers only.  One of the most celebrated
Cavalry attacks was that of the regiment of Anspach-Bayreuth Dragoons
in the battle of Hohenfriedberg (4th June, 1745). In this action, the
regiment rode down no fewer than 20 battalions of Infantry, took 2,500
prisoners and 66 standards, besides a large number of guns: as
Frederick the Great said, âIt is a feat unparalleled in history.â
This regiment was, at a later period, turned into a Cuirassier
regiment, and is now known as the Queenâs 2nd Cuirassiers
(Pomeranians).</p>

<p>The Bavarian Chevau-lÃ©gers correspond to the Prussian Dragoons, and
many a record testifies to their gallantry in action.</p>

<p>The spirit of Zieten, the âHussar-father,â and of old BlÃ¼cher,
âField Marshal Forwards,â still lives in the Hussars of the German
Empire. Activity, boldness, and cheeriness are the attributes which
make a good Hussar, and many are the songs which record their
successes in camp and field.</p>

<p>The Uhlans (Lancers) who spread such terror amongst the enemy in
the war of 1870â71, hail, as far as their name goes, from Tartary.<a
id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a
href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> For this reason, the
French took them for a wild tribe, such as the Kirghiz of the Steppes,
or the African Turcos. The name is, however, the only foreign element
about them, for their mode of fighting is essentially German.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="fig012">

     src="images/fig012.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Bavarian<br />Halberdier.<br />(Full-dress.)</p>
</div>

<p>The chief weapon of the Uhlan, the lance, with which they caused
such consternation among the French, although it had been the most
popular weapon of the Middle Ages, disappeared almost entirely from
European armies on the introduction of firearms; the Russian and
Polish Cavalry alone retaining it. After the second Silesian war in
1745, Frederick the Great armed a body of Light Horse with lances, and
gave them the name of âBosniaks.â  Consisting at first of only 1
âcompany,â their strength was increased afterwards to 10 companies,
and in the year 1800 they
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
were founded into a regiment under the name of âTowarczys,â
<i>i.e.</i>, experienced in war. In 1808, the name was changed to
âUhlans,â and the corps was divided into several regiments, whose
number was increased at a later period. In 1870 the French peasantry
called the whole of the German Cavalry âulans,â and the sudden
appearance of a few of their horsemen in a district at a time when the
Frenchmen flattered themselves that the enemy was still far distant,
caused shouts of âles ulans! les ulans!â universal consternation, and
immediate flight.  The German Uhlans were everywhere at once. More
than one populous town, <i>e.g.</i>, Nancy on the 11th August, 1870,
opened their gates at their approach, and the small fortress of Vitry
le franÃ§ois surrendered to a mere handful of Uhlans.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Cavalry of the German Empire consists
altogether of 93 regiments of 5 squadrons eachâtotal, 465
squadrons. On the regiment being ordered on active service, one of the
squadrons remains behind as supply-squadron for the rest. Its duty is
to replace the partially-trained or unserviceable horses by good ones,
and also to fill up the ranks of the other squadrons with good men
when required. By this means, the active part of the regiment is
brought to a high state of readiness for action, and gains greatly in
efficiency. There are:â</p>

<p>14 regiments of Cuirassiers, including:</p>

<p class="hang1">&ensp;The Garde-du-Corps regiment,</p>
<p class="hang1">&ensp;The Guard Cuirassier regiment,</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of late years there has been a good deal of talk about reorganising
the present force into a so-called âGeneralâ Cavalry, and this would
be distinctly a move in the right direction. The term implies that all
branches of the Cavalry arm should be equally and thoroughly equipped,
armed, and trained for any service in which Cavalry could be called on
to take part.  An important step has been made in this direction by
the recent arming of the <i>whole</i> of the Cavalry with
lances. There is, however, no intention whatever on the part of the
authorities to carry out the idea to extremities. Such measures as
taking away their particular mode of action from the different
branches of the Cavalry, or giving them all exactly the same uniform,
would never be entertained for a moment.  It is obvious that such
measures would be the deathblow of all <i>esprit de corps</i> which,
as we know, has led to such brilliant results in the past. The shock
of Cuirassiers on their big horses, the charge of Uhlans with their
fluttering lance-pennons, the sabre-work of Hussars, and the mobility
of Dragoons and Chevau-lÃ©gers, each has its particular effect on the
enemy, and each distinctive attribute must be taken into serious
account. There can be no doubt that a total amalgamation of the four
branches, and the abolition of their distinctive uniforms, would
produce much more harm in the end than good.</p>

<p class="skip1">Before closing the subject of Cavalry, mention ought to be made of
the lately-formed Empressâs Body-Guard, composed of one officer, two
sergeants, and 24 men.  They were first put on duty in August, 1889,
during the visit of the Emperor of Austria. Their uniform is the usual
dark-blue tunic, with cerise collar and cuffs, besides a full-dress
white Cuirassier tunic.  The skirts are lined with cerise cloth and
fastened back with hooks. Both collar and cuffs have white braid-lace
on them, like the rest of the Guard Corps. The breeches are of white
leather, and big knee-boots like those of the Cuirassiers complete the
costume.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artillery.</div>

<p class="sind">Artillery has but one rÃ´le to play on the
battle-field, and that is to come into action and do as much harm as
possible to the enemy from a long distance off.</p>

<p>The German arm is divided into Field Artillery and Garrison
Artillery.</p>

<p>The Field Artillery is intended, as its name implies, for action on
the field of battle. One particular branch of it forms the Horse
Artillery, in which all the men are mounted. The whole of the Field
Artillery is armed with Krupp cast-steel guns (C. 73), the Horse
Artillery guns having a bore of 2Â·95, and the others a bore of 3Â·43
inches.  They carry âdouble-ring shellsâ (a form of segment shell
which fly into about 180 pieces), Shrapnel shells (each containing 240
bullets), and case-shot. The guns themselves are handy to work, and
carry with great accuracy up to about four miles.</p>

<p>A Battery is formed of six guns, though as a rule not more than
four in peace-time have teams (4 to 6 horses each) to draw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>There are altogether 318 batteries of Field-and 46 batteries of
Horse Artillery, the whole forming 37 regiments.</p>

<p>To the Prussian group belong 29 regiments, forming 245 Field-and 38
Horse Artillery batteriesâtotal 283 batteries.</p>

<p>Saxony has 2 regiments (Nos. 12 and 28) forming 21 Field-and 2
Horse Artillery batteries.</p>

<p>WÃ¼rttemberg has 2 regiments (Nos. 13 and 29), forming 18 Field
batteries.</p>

<p>Bavaria has 4 regiments, forming 34 Field-and 6 Horse Artillery
batteries.</p>

<p>Grand Total, 364 batteries.</p>

<p>Of the 29 âPrussianâ regiments, 2 are Guard Artillery, 24
(Nos. 1â11, 15â24, 26, 27, and 31) are Prussian, 2 belong to Baden
(Nos. 14 and 30), and 1 (No. 25) is Hessian.</p>

<p>In the course of the next few years the Field Artillery will
undergo considerable changes in matÃ©riel as well as in
organisation. It is intended to give each Army Corps 3 F. A.
regiments, each of 2 divisions of 3 batteries each. Thus each of the
two divisions of the Army Corps would have one F. A. regiment of 6
batteries, and the 3rd regiment would be available as Corps
Artillery. It is also proposed to introduce a common calibre of gun
for the whole, both Field and Horse Artillery, and also a common
projectile which would combine the advantages of common shell and
shrapnel. The introduction of this latter would tend greatly to
simplify both the action and the supply of the gun.</p>

<p class="caption1">Bavarian Officer of Lancers.<br /> (Aide-de-Camp.)</p>
</div>

<p>The men of the Garrison Artillery are employed in the attack and
defence of fortresses. They have no guns of their own, but simply work
the big guns of the Siege-train or the fortresses, according to
circumstances.  These gunners go by the name of âcannoniers.â  They
are armed with the Mauser carbine of the 1871 pattern.</p>

<p>The Garrison Artillery consists of 14 regiments of 2 battalions
each, of 4 companies each, besides 3 independent battalions,
altogether 31 battalions.</p>

<p>Of this force, Prussia has 11 regiments (1 Guard regiment and Nos. 1
to 8, 10 and 11) and 2 independent battalions (No. 9 and No. 14), the
latter belonging to Baden.</p>

<p>Saxony has 1 regiment (No. 12).</p>

<p>WÃ¼rttemberg has 1 battalion (No. 13), and</p>

<p class="skip1">Bavaria has 2 regiments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Engineers.</div>

<p class="sind">There remain yet the Engineers and the Train.</p>

<p>The officers of the corps of Engineers are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
divided into the Engineer Staff Corps (<i>i.e.</i>, generals and field
officers) and 4 âEngineer-Inspectionsâ (captains and lieutenants).</p>

<p>This is in the Prussian group. The Saxon, WÃ¼rttemberg, and Bavarian
officers are not so divided. Engineer officers are employed either
with the âfortification branch,â <i>i.e.</i>, that branch which
superintends the construction, repair, etc., of fortresses, or with
the âPioneers,â <i>i.e.</i>, Field Engineers.</p>

<p>There are in the German Army nineteen Pioneer battalions,
distributed thus:</p>

<p>1 Guard battalion and 14 others (Nos.  1â11, 14â16), including 1
Baden battalion (No. 13), to Prussia.</p>

<p>1 battalion to Saxony (No. 12),</p>

<p>1 battalion to WÃ¼rttemberg (No. 18), and</p>

<p>2 battalions to Bavaria.</p>

<p>Each battalion numbers 4 companies; of these the 1st is a Pontoon
company, the 2nd and 3rd are Sapper companies: <i>i.e.</i>, for
sap-work, construction of siege-batteries, and field-works, etc.; and
the 4th is a Mining company, for laying mines and subterranean
galleries in siege-work.</p>

<p class="skip1">Besides these, there is a Railway Regiment of 4
battalions (including 1 Saxon and 1 WÃ¼rttemberg company), and 1
Bavarian Railway battalion of 2 companies, for the construction of
military railways and railway-bridges. Included in the Railway
Regiment are the Field-Telegraph and Balloon sections.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Train.</div>

<p class="sind">The âTrainâ (corresponding to our Army Service
Corps) is for the transport of supplies, ammunition, and war-material
of all sorts. The drivers and men of the corps are trained in
peace-time in the Train battalions, and the wagons are stored in Train
depÃ´ts.</p>

<p>There are 19 Train battalions and 1 company, thus divided:</p>

<p>14 battalions, each of 2 to 3 companies, and a depÃ´t (the Guard
battalion, and Nos. 1â11, 15 and 16), in Prussia; one (No. 14), in
Baden, and 1 Train company in Hesse; one (No. 12) in Saxony, one in
WÃ¼rttemberg (No. 13), and 2 in Bavaria.</p>

<p>To the depÃ´t of each battalion belong:
5 provision sections, 3 medical detachments
with field hospitals and bearers, 1 remount-depÃ´t,
1 field bakery section, and 5 sections
of transport.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tactical Organisa&shy;tion.</div>

<p class="sind">The above account gives a general rÃ©sumÃ© of the
fighting force of Germany.  It now remains to give the tactical
organisation of the different branches of the Army.</p>

<p>In the Infantry, the smallest independent body of troops, or
âtactical unit,â is a battalion (except in the case of the independent
Rifle battalions, where the unit is represented by the company). In
the Cavalry it is a squadron, and in the Artillery a battery. The war
strength of a battalion is, at the outside, 1,000 men; that of a
squadron is about 150 mounted men; and that of a battery is 6 guns,
with 12 wagons and men in proportion. The peace-strength of each unit
is dependent, on the one hand, on the numbers required for its full
strength in time of war; and, on the other hand, on the amount of
training requisite for its efficiency. In a less degree also, it is
dependent on the state of the Treasury.</p>

<p>The peace-strength of a Prussian Line battalion (4 companies)
is<span class="nlbr">:â</span></p>

<ul class="nobullet">
  <li>1 major (commanding the battalion),</li>
  <li>4 captains,</li>
  <li>12 lieutenants and 2nd lieutenants,</li>
  <li>1 adjutant (usually a lieutenant),</li>
  <li>559 N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs and men, and</li>
  <li><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
      7 others (paymaster, assistant-paymaster,
      4 privates trained as medical assistants,
      and 1 armourer-sergeant).</li>
</ul>

<p>N.B.âA Regiment of Infantry consists of three battalions, so that
in calculating the strength of a regiment, the regimental staff
(colonel, lieutenant-colonel, regimental-adjutant, surgeons, etc.),
should be taken into account.</p>

<p>That of a Prussian Cavalry Regiment of five squadrons is:â</p>

<ul class="nobullet">
  <li>25 officers,</li>
  <li>2 or 3 surgeons,</li>
  <li>686 N.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;O.âs and men,</li>
  <li>14 others (paymasters, veterinary surgeons,
      medical assistants, armourers, etc., etc.), and</li>
  <li>667 horses.</li>
</ul>

<p class="skip1">The peace-strength of the corresponding troops in
Bavaria, WÃ¼rttemberg, and Saxony is much the same. The Guard regiments
and those in Alsace-Lorraine are somewhat stronger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Formation of Brigades, Divisions, and Army Corps.</div>

<p class="sind">As a rule, two regiments of Infantry (6
battalions), or two of Cavalry (8 to 10 squadrons), form a Brigade,
under a Major-general as brigadier.</p>

<p>The first unit composed of all three arms is the Infantry
division. It consists of usually two brigades of Infantry and one
regiment of Cavalry; and, in the field, has in addition 6 batteries of
Artillery and 1 company of Engineers, the whole under the command of a
lieutenant-general. A Cavalry Division varies in strength, but has
always, if possible, one or two batteries of Horse Artillery
attached.</p>

<p>Two, or three, Infantry Divisions, with a brigade (2 regiments) of
Field Artillery,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Engineers and Train, constitute an Army Corps, under the command of a
full general. The Army Corps therefore comprises all branches of the
service, and is thoroughly independent.</p>

<p class="skip1">The 12th (Saxon) and 13th (WÃ¼rttemberg) Corps have a
slightly different composition. They each number 4 Infantry, 2 Cavalry
and 1 Field Artillery Brigades (each brigade consisting of 2
regiments), besides one battalion of Field Engineers and one of the
Train. The Guard Corps also is constituted rather differently from any
other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Size of Army.</div>

<p class="sind">On the 1st April, 1890, the entire German Army
consisted of 20 Army Corps, quartered as follows:â</p>

<p>The Guard Corps, in Berlin, Potsdam, Charlottenburg, and Spandau
(with the exception of the 4th Guard Grenadier Regiment, which is
quartered at Coblenz).</p>

<p>The nineteen Territorial Districts of the Army correspond to the
nineteen Army Corps Districts. The recruits, however, of the XVth and
XVIth Corps districts are not allowed to serve there, but are
distributed amongst other corps. The Guard Corps draws its recruits
from the different districts of Prussia, and from Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>The main idea which directed the above recent apportioning of
troops was to distribute them so as to be immediately available in
case of war in any quarter.  Formerly, the tendency was to group the
forces where they could be most conveniently trained and worked,
without reference to the possibilities of war.</p>

<p>Now that the new distribution of Army Corps has placed three Corps
(XIVth, XVth, and XVIth) on the western, and four Corps (Ist, IInd,
Vth, XVIIth) on the eastern frontier, it will be possible at the first
declaration of war with either France or Russia to combine large masses
of Cavalry and throw them at once into the enemyâs territory. One or
two battalions of JÃ¤ger are also to be sent shortly into Alsace, in
order to watch the passes over the Vosges.</p>

<p>The peace-strength of the German Army is reckoned atâ</p>

<ul class="nobullet">
  <li>534 Battalions of Infantry,</li>
  <li>465 Squadrons of Cavalry,</li>
  <li>364 Batteries of Artillery with 1,500 fully-horsed guns.</li>
  <li>Total, 19,457 officers and 468,400 men.</li>
</ul>

<p>In consequence of the extension of the Landwehr and Landsturm, it
is difficult to arrive at an exact estimate of the German
war-strength.<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a
href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> In the event of war,
different Army Corps and Cavalry Divisions will be combined into
Armies, but their number
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and strength will necessarily depend on the theatre in which they are
to be utilised, on the plan of campaign, and on the strength of the
enemy. The resources of the Empire will not, however, come to an end
with the 20 Army Corps whose strength we have just been
describing. Behind the men doing their seven years of service, who
compose the Active Army, come those of the 1st and 2nd Class Landwehr,
and behind these again come the Ersatz Reserve and the Landsturm.</p>

<p>Although this tremendous Army of close on two million of
well-trained and well-armed men may at first sight appear a menace to
the peace of the world, still we must remember that Germany is
absolutely obliged, for the preservation of her very existence, to
keep up these huge forces, and that she has no intention of using them
except for that purpose. As an old national proverb has it: âHe who
wants to come to grief in war had better try a fall with Germany.â</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> next on the list is
Germanyâs powerful neighbour, friend, and ally on her southern frontier,
Austria-Hungary.</p>

<p>There is in the Austro-Hungarian Army a varied assemblage of
different races: the honest Austrian, the proud and fiery Hungarian,
the smart Czech, the true-hearted Tyrolese, the thin onion-eating
Wallachian, the hot-blooded Croat, the nomad Slowak, the homeless
gipsy, etc., etc., are all represented in its ranks. All these have
been welded together by the iron bands of discipline into the âImperial
and Royalâ Army. The Emperor is Commander-in-Chief, and with him rests
the decision for peace or war.</p>

<p class="skip1">After the disastrous campaign of 1866 the Austrian
Army was entirely reorganised.  The reorganisation is now almost
completed, and the Army now takes its place as one of the foremost in
the world. The division of the Empire into Cis- and
Trans-Leithaniaâ<i>i.e.</i> this side, the Austrian, and that side,
<i>i.e.</i> the Hungarian, of the Leitha, a tributary of the Danube,
is only partially carried out in the military system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">According to the conscription law of December,
1868, universal conscription is now the rule; in the whole
Austro-Hungarian Empire, and exemption by purchase, formerly allowed,
is now abolished.  The forces are divided into the Standing Army, the
Ersatz Reserve, the Landwehr, and the Landsturm.</p>

<p class="skip1">About 103,000 recruits are yearly admitted into the
Standing Army, of which Cis-Leithania contributes 54,000. Those
able-bodied young men who are not taken into the Standing or Active
Army are sent for ten years to the Ersatz Reserve, which is intended,
as in Germany, to provide reinforcements for the Active Army. Service
in the latter is for three years with the Colours and seven years in
the Active Reserve.  Service in the Landwehr is for two years for
those who have served ten years in the Active Army and Reserve or in
the Ersatz Reserve, and for twelve years for those who have been sent
straight thither, for various reasons, on conscription. After the
Landwehr service, the soldier is sent for five years to the 1st Class
Landsturm, and for five years more to the 2nd Class Landsturm.  By
this time he is forty-two years of age.  The one-year Volunteers are
enlisted in the same manner as in Germany (q.&nbsp;v.).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organisa&shy;tion.</div>

<p class="sind">The whole Empire is, for military purposes,
divided into fifteen Territorial Districts; these are of various
sizes, so that the Austrian Army Corps are not all of the same
strength. In case of war, the whole âImperial and Royalâ Army would be
grouped into three armies, under
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
one supreme command, each army consisting of three or more Army
Corps. The Army Corps consists of 2 Infantry Divisions, each of 2
brigades. The division is commanded by a âfield-marshal-lieutenant,â
corresponding to our lieutenant-general, and the brigade by a
major-general.</p>

<p class="skip1">Each Infantry brigade has as a rule 2 regiments, and
1 battalion of Rifles.  Besides the 2 Infantry brigades, each Division
has in addition 2 to 4 squadrons of Cavalry, 1 battery division (2 to
3 batteries of Field Artillery), and 1 company of Engineers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Infantry.</div>

<p class="sind">The Infantry of the Active Army comprises 102
regiments, each of 4 Field and 1 Ersatz battalions; the latter is in
peace-time represented by a cadre only. The 4th Field battalions,
so-called âMobileâ battalions, have mostly a stronger
peace-establishment than the others, and are used to garrison Bosnia,
Herzegovina, and the Sanjak of Novi-Bazar; <i>i.e.</i> they are
completely separated from their regiments.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="fig015">
<img class="smallbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig015.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Officer of Infantry<br />(Marching Order).</p>
</div>

<p>The Rifles comprise the Tyrolese Rifle Regiment of 10 Active and 2
Ersatz battalions, and 32 independent battalions of Rifles, each of 4
Field and 1 Ersatz companies.</p>

<p>The Infantry has (since 1868) laid aside its historical white
uniform, and is now clothed in dark blue tunics or loose jackets, and
light blue trousers, the latter in the Hungarian regiments being
ornamented with embroidery and fitting like tights. The Hungarian
regiments wear lace-boots, the remainder Wellingtons.  The usual
head-dress is the fatigue-cap, and, on great occasions, the shako. The
Rifles are dressed in blue-grey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>After 1866 the Austrian Infantry was armed with an excellent
breech-loader, the Werndl rifle. Since the German Infantry have
attained a certain moral superiority by being armed with a
magazine-rifle, the authorities have introduced a magazine-rifle for
the Infantry and Rifles.</p>

<p>So quickly has the work of manufacturing and issuing them
proceeded, that by the autumn of this year (1890) it is expected that
they will all be thus armed, and will have overtaken the German
Infantry. The new Austrian magazine-rifle, called after its inventor,
Colonel MÃ¤nnlicher, is of Â·315-inch bore, and can fire 30 to 40 shots
in the minute.</p>

<p class="skip1">Austria possesses an excellent Rifle Regiment in the
Tyrolese, the so-called Emperor Rifles, mentioned above, which is
composed of men accustomed from their youth up to the use of the
rifle. They are recruited in the Tyrol and Vorarlberg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cavalry.</div>

<p class="sind">The Cavalry of the Active Army consists ofâ</p>

<table class="regiments" summary="Austrian cavalry">
  <tr>
    <td>14</td><td>Regiments of Dragoons (Austrians and Bohemians),</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>11</td><td>Regiments of Lancers (with Polish Reserve).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Each regiment consists of 6 squadrons and a depÃ´t-cadre. In case of
mobilisation the latter develops into one Ersatz squadron (in which
are trained the Ersatz men and the extra horses required), one Reserve
squadron for supply purposes, and two sections of Staff Cavalry for
service at the headquarters of Corps and at Field-Supply stores. The
peace establishment of the Austro-Hungarian Cavalry accordingly comes
to 246 squadrons, and the war-establishment to 246 Field, 41 Reserve,
and 41 Ersatz squadrons, besides the Staff Cavalry.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig016">
<img class="smallbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig016.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Cavalry Officer (Undress).</p>
</div>

<p>The Cavalry Regiments are clothed according to their
nationality. The Dragoons wear a light-blue tunic, the Uhlans their
tunic of peculiar cut, and the Hussars the jacket and attila, the
latter as a rule suspended by yellow cords from the shoulder. The
whole Cavalry wear red breeches, tight in the Hussar regiments, and
loose in the others.</p>

<p>The Hungarian Hussars, on their small but swift horses, are a
peculiarly national institution. These Hussars (from a Magyar word
âhusz,â meaning âtwenty,â from the fact that every twenty houses in
Hungary had to provide one horseman in days gone by) have always been
particularly prominent in the Austrian Army and were long held to be
pre-eminent in their mode of fighting, until Frederick II. formed some
regiments after their pattern. These were afterwards increased to ten
in number, and, under celebrated leaders like Zieten, soon won for
themselves renown equal to that of their Hungarian cousins.</p>

<p class="skip1">The whole of the Cavalry is armed alike, with sword
and Werndl carbine. The Uhlansâ lances have been done away with since
1884, but there is a question of the re-introduction of this old
Polish weapon. After the Infantry has been fully armed with the
magazine-rifle, the Cavalry will, it is said, be armed with
repeating-carbines, which will have been served out by next spring
(1891). This is an example which, it is to be hoped, other armies will
soon follow.<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a
href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Artillery.</div>

<p class="sind">The Artillery comprises Field and Garrison
Artillery. The Field Artillery consists of 14 regiments of Corps
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Artillery, numbered according to their Army Corps and each of 5
batteries; and of 28 independent Heavy Battery Divisions, each of 3
batteries. Several Corps Artillery Regiments have in addition a couple
of Horse Artillery Batteries, or a Mountain Battery.</p>

<p>The batteries have each in peace-time 4, and in war-time 8,
fully-horsed guns.  An exception to this are the Horse Artillery
batteries, which always have 6 guns in the battery.</p>

<p>The Mountain Batteries, which have been found most useful in
campaigns in Dalmatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, are a peculiar feature
of the Austrian Artillery. Their guns can be dismounted and packed on
the backs of mules, and in this way they can be transported along
narrow mountain-paths.</p>

<p>The Corps Artillery Regiments are to have their number of batteries
increased by one each, but this will barely be completed before
1892.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig017">
<img class="bigbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig017.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Royal Hungarian Body-Guard.</p>
</div>

<p>The Austrian Field Artillery has an excellent weapon in the shape
of the 2Â·95-inch Uchatius steel bronze gun, and also that of the
3Â·43-inch bronze gun for the heavy batteries, both equal in worth to
the Krupp gun. The shells are of the German pattern, but the shrapnel
have fewer bullets than the German ones. Besides these projectiles,
case-shot, fire-shells, and so-called high-angle shells, for bursting
among troops behind cover, are carried with the battery.</p>

<p>The Garrison Artillery numbers 12 battalions, each of 5 Field and 1
DepÃ´t-cadre companies. Eighteen more battalions have been projected,
and will be formed in the course of the next few years according to
the amount of money in hand.</p>

<p class="skip1">The uniform of the Artillery is dark-brown. The men
are armed with sword and revolver, those of the Garrison Artillery
carrying the Werndl rifle instead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Engineers.</div>

<p class="sind">The Corps of Engineers is composed of the Engineer
Staff and Engineer troops.  The former is exclusively composed of
officers; the latter of 2 regiments of 5 battalions each. Each
battalion has 4 Field, 1 Reserve, and 1 DepÃ´t-cadre companies.  The
Pioneer Regiment, not considered as Engineers, consists of 5
battalions, similarly constituted to the Engineer battalions.</p>

<p>The Railway and Telegraph Regiment, which has but recently been
formed, after the German model, consists of 2 Field and 1 DepÃ´t-cadre
battalions.</p>

<p>The Train consists of 3 regiments of 5 squadrons each and a
DepÃ´t-cadre.</p>

<p class="skip1">There is no Guard Corps in the Austrian Army, so
several bodies of troops have been formed for the honour of protecting
the Emperor person and guarding his palaces.  These are the Arcieren
squadron of Life-Guards, the Hungarian Body-Guard, the Trabanten
Body-Guard, the squadron of Horse-Guards, and the Infantry Company of
the Guard. These troops are richly dressed in peculiar uniforms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reserve Troops.</div>

<p class="sind">The Landwehr is formed into two distinct bodies,
which are also quite distinct from the Active Army; each Landwehr is
under its own ministry of defence. In peace-time only the cadres
exist; that is to say, that of 92 Infantry battalions and 6 Cavalry
regiments (24 squadrons) of Cis-Leithanian Landwehr, only 1 strong
company per battalion and 1 strong squadron per Cavalry Regiment are
kept up.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Native Rifles (LandesschÃ¼tzen) of the Tyrol and
Vorarlberg consist of 10 battalions in time of peace, which are in
war-time increased by ten Reserve battalions.</p>

<p class="sind">In Trans-Leithania the Landwehr forms <span
class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> a
peculiar national Hungarian Army, the so-called HonvÃ©d Army, which is
subject in war-time only to the commander-in-chief, and in peace-time
only to the Royal Hungarian jurisdiction, <i>i.e.</i> the Ministry of
Defence and the Landwehr Ministry. It forms in peace-time the Cadres
for 92 battalions of Infantry and 15 regiments of HonvÃ©d Hussars (60
squadrons).  The officers of this force are trained in the HonvÃ©d
Ludovica Academy at Buda Pesth. It is on this Army, whose standards
and badges are of the Hungarian colours, and which in time of war
reaches nearly 200,000 men, that the pride of Hungary rests. It is
this Army whose predecessors saved the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy from
destruction a century and a half ago. On the 21st of September, 1741,
the Empress Queen, Maria Theresa, came to her Parliament at Presburg
in dire distress.  Dressed in the national Hungarian dress, with her
newly born son (destined to become Joseph II.) in her arms, pain and
courage depicted on her noble countenance,
she advanced towards the Hungarian nobles, and in a powerful Latin
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
speech asked for the National Army to be called out, to protect her
and her country from her many foes. Then the Hungarian magnates tore
their crooked swords from their scabbards, clashed them wildly
together, and shouted: âMoriamur pro rege nostro Maria Theresa!â With
the help of her brave Hungarians, Maria Theresa, after making peace
with Frederick II. of Prussia, succeeded in beating off her numerous
enemies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclu&shy;sions.</div>

<p class="sind">If we consider that the total strength (on a war
establishment) of the Austro-Hungarian Army, Line and Landwehr
included, exceeds one million of trained men, of which 778,889 belong
to the 1st Line, and we remember that the Cis-Leithanians are in no
way inferior in warlike spirit, that inheritance of their forefathers,
to their brethren on the far side of the Leitha, we shall come to the
conclusion that in the Austrian Army, with its excellent Corps of
officers and excellent material in the shape of men and horses, any
State in Europe would find either a powerful adversary or a most
desirable ally.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> Italy we have the
third of the Powers who have formed the Triple Alliance in order to
maintain the peace of Europe and to make common cause against any
disturber thereof. The history of this country has been very similar to
that of Germany. In this instance also, an energetic Prince, King Victor
Emmanuel of Sardinia (died 1878), supported by an active statesman,
Count Cavour, placed himself at the head of the national movement in
favour of unity, and formed the various States of the Peninsula into one
kingdom under his rule.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Italy appears thenceforth as the last formed among
the European Powers, and it has raised an excellent Army in order to
maintain its position as such.  The development of the latter has
since that time progressed considerably, and especially so during the
last decade, when a distinct advance has been apparent.</p>

<p class="skip1">Constituted on the principle of Universal
Conscription, the land forces of Italy are formed, similarly to those
of the German Empire, into a Standing Army, a Landwehr (Milizia
mobile), and a Landsturm (Milizia territoriale).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">The liability to serve commences with the
twentieth year, and continues till the thirty-ninth.  It consists of
eight years in the Standing Army (three with the Colours and five in
the Reserve); four years in the Landwehr, and seven years in the
Landsturm.  Those who have been exempted from service by ballot are
sent straight to the Landsturm for nineteen years.</p>

<p>When the young men attain the age rendering them liable to serve,
those physically unfit are âcast,â and some are put back who are ill
or excused for domestic reasons. The remainder of the men draw lots
and are placed according to their lottery number in the 1st or 2nd
class, those excused being placed in the 3rd class. The 1st class
conscripts are distributed throughout the Standing Army. The 2nd class
go through three monthsâ training, to form an Ersatz (or reinforcing)
Reserve, and the 3rd class men are called out every four years for a
few days at a time for instruction in the use and manipulation of
their arms.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Standing Army consists accordingly of eight
yearly batches of the 1st class and eight of the 2nd class; the
Landwehr of four yearly batches of men who have served their time in
the Standing Army, and four batches of the 2nd class; and the
Landsturm comprises seven batches of the 1st, seven of the 2nd, and
nineteen of the 3rd class.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Infantry.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p class="sind">The Infantry of the Standing Army consists of 96
regiments (including 2 Grenadier regiments), each of 3 battalions and
1 Ersatz company. Besides these, there are the special Corps dâÃlite,
the Bersaglieri (âmarksmenââfrom bersaglia = a target), and the Alpini
(Alpine Rifles).</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig019">
<img class="bigbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig019.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Bersagliere of the African Contingent.</p>
</div>

<p>The Bersaglieri, in 12 regiments, each of 3 battalions and 1 Ersatz
company, are Light Infantry, trained to execute all movements at the
âdouble,â exceedingly good shots, and looking very smart in their neat
uniforms, the large hats of which are ornamented with a waving bunch
of cock feathers.</p>

<p>The Alpine Troops consist of 7 regiments (forming 75 companies), to
which are attached 9 mountain batteries. These are also considered
Corps dâÃlite.</p>

<p>Composed of herdsmen and gamekeepers, familiar with every footpath
in the Alps, never fatigued, quick of sight and hearing, and excellent
shots, they are equally valuable in reconnoitring work or on the field
of battle, although their original rÃ´le is that of acting in defence
of their mountain passes. The Alpine companies are placed in summer as
near as possible to the particular mountain passes whose defence is
assigned to them, and are stationed for only half the year in the
towns as winter quarters.</p>

<p>Their duty is carried out with a particular object in view, and
consists mostly in shooting, skirmishing, constant marches over
mountain paths, reconnaissance duty and patrolling, and in minor
tactics.</p>

<p class="skip1">The whole of the Italian Infantry is at this moment
armed (until the alteration of their former weapon, the single-loader
Vetterli, is completed) with an excellent repeating rifle, the
Vitali. Particular attention is paid to musketry instruction, and
facilities for shooting are given and encouraged by the holding of
National Rifle Meetings at stated times. At these meetings, any
soldier on furlough is allowed to compete, with his Service rifle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cavalry.</div>

<p class="sind">The Cavalry of the Italian Army, on account of the
scarcity of useful horses, and the mountainous character of the land,
is weak in comparison with the Cavalry of other European armies.</p>

<p>It consists of 24 regiments, each of 6 squadrons and an
Ersatz-cadre; <i>i.e.</i>, 10 Lancer regiments and 14 regiments of
Light Cavalry (Cavalleggieri).</p>

<p class="skip1">The Light Cavalry are armed with a long curved sword,
and the Lancers with a lance. In addition to these weapons, the whole
of the Cavalry is armed with a rifled breech-loading carbine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artillery.</div>

<p class="sind">The Field Artillery consists of 24 regiments, each
of 8 batteries; there are also 6 Horse Artillery and 9 Mountain
batteries.  It can put in the field in war-time 1,196 guns. The heavy
batteries are armed with 3Â·54-inch breech-loaders; the Light and Horse
Artillery batteries with 2Â·76-inch breech-loaders. The mountain guns,
for the transport of each of which three horses or mules are provided,
are of 2Â·95-inch calibre, of steel-bronze, and mounted on wooden
carriages.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Garrison Artillery consists of 5 regiments; the
Siege-train of 2 partsâeach of 200 guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Engineers.</div>

<p class="sind">The Engineers consist of 4 regiments, including a
Railway and Telegraph Company, a Pontoon and a Bridging Troop.</p>

<p>The Artillery and Engineers provide their own Train.</p>

<p>12 Commissariat companies are told off for service in the
depÃ´ts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p class="skip1">The men of the Field Artillery and Engineers carry a revolver
besides a sword; Garrison Artillerymen are armed with a breech-loading
carbine.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Gendar&shy;merie.</div>

<div class="figright" id="fig020">
<img class="bigbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig020.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Carbineer.</p>
</div>

<p class="sind">There is also a Corps closely connected with the
Army which deserves mention, namely, the Gendarmes, or âCarabinieri
Reali,â whose strength amounts to 543 officers, 22,487 Foot Gendarmes,
and 11 legions of Mounted Gendarmes.</p>

<p>Formerly many a story was told of the fights between the
Carabinieri and the banditti. Nowadays, both the robbers and the old
Carabinieri have disappeared, and the present Carabinieri Reali form
an excellent Corps, whose duty it is to maintain peace and good order
in the country.</p>

<p class="skip1">In war-time a battalion of them is sent with each
Army Corps. They have then to provide orderlies for the Staff, as well
as to act as Military Police.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organis&shy;ation.</div>

<p class="sind">The whole kingdom is divided into
twelve Army Corps Districts.</p>

<p>In peace-time the Army Corps vary in strength. In war, each Army
Corps consists of 2 Divisions, the Division numbering 2 Brigades (each
brigade consisting of 2 regiments of Infantry), and an Artillery
Division of 3 batteries.  Besides these, each Army Corps has 1
regiment of Bersaglieri, 1 or 2 Artillery Divisions, each of 4
batteries, 1 regiment of Cavalry, 2 companies of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Engineers, with bridging-train, and 1 battalion of Carabinieri,
forming altogether 27 battalions of Infantry, 5 or 6 squadrons of
Cavalry, 12 to 16 batteries of Artillery, and 2 companies of
Engineers, etc.âtotal, about 29,000 men and 112 guns.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Alpini are not included in the Corps organisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milizie.</div>

<p class="sind">The Landwehr consists of 48 regiments of Infantry,
18 battalions of Bersaglieri, 22 Alpine Companies, 61 batteries of
Artillery, and 35 companies of Engineers. It is formed into twelve
divisions in time of war.</p>

<p class="skip1">Besides the above, there are 342 battalions, 30
Engineer companies, and 100 companies of Foot Artillery of the
Landsturm, for garrison purpose. In peace-time depÃ´ts for the Landwehr
and Landsturm are not organised: preparations are however being made
for instituting them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclu&shy;sions.</div>

<p class="sind">In this manner is organised the Army which has now
for about ten years proudly taken its place alongside the proved and
war-tried armies of the senior Powers.  Anyone accustomed to English
or German troops, such as the Brigade of Guards in Hyde Park, or the
German Foot-Guards at Potsdam, will find much that is strange on
seeing the Italian Army, resulting from the peculiarity of race. He
will miss the upright bearing, the regular movements and the steady
drill of the Infantry, and the well-groomed and glossy horses of the
Cavalry; but he will be pleased with the picturesque uniforms of the
Army, the extremely smart appearance and active movements of the
Bersaglieri, with their waving green plumes, and with the martial and
powerful bearing of the Alpini, with their upright plumes in their
head-dress; and he will find that the cry of âEvviva il Re Umbertoâ
sounds just as loud and strong here as our own English âGod save the
Queen.â The impression that he will take away with him will be that
the like spirit of the ancient Romans has not been lost in their
descendants, and that the young kingdom of Italy is well prepared to
throw her Army as a decisive weight on to the side of victory in some
future European war.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> next on the list is
France, our nearest continental neighbour, who for a long time was the
foremost of European Military Powers. In the disastrous war of 1870 she
lost this position entirely, and has ever since then been making the
most strenuous exertions to regain something of her old strength by
thorough revision and reorganisation of her Army.</p>

<p>The laws of 1872 and 1873 were passed with a view to
this object, and by them Universal Conscription was introduced, as in
Germany. On economical grounds, all able-bodied conscripts were
divided into two classes, the first of which serves five years with
the Colours, and the second only one year.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">After his five yearsâ active service (or one year,
as the case may be) the soldier goes for four (or eight) years to the
Active Reserve. Thereafter he enters the Territorial Army for five
years, and the Territorial Army Reserve for a subsequent six years,
making twenty years in all. The Active Army and its Reserve form the
Army of the 1st Line, and the Territorial Army and its Reserve the
Army of the 2nd Line.</p>

<p>The institution of one-year Volunteers covers a much larger area
than in the German Army. The main point looked to in a would-be
one-year Volunteer is whether he can pay his 1,500 francs; the
scientific and educational certificates required from such candidates
in Germany are quite a secondary consideration in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote">New Law.</div>

<p class="sind">France was not content with following the German
model when she re-constituted her Army, but endeavoured to organise a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
system whereby an enormous number of trained soldiers should be turned
out in the shortest possible timeâsomething like the âlevÃ©e en masseâ
which took place at the time of the French Revolution in 1793.  This
has been the aim of successive war ministers since 1871. It seems to
have been brought to a conclusive issue by the law of the 15th July,
1889, which for severity and harshness appears to surpass any military
sacrifices and duties ever demanded of any people.</p>

<p class="sind">The main points of this law are as follows:â</p>

<p>1. Extension of liability to service from
twenty to twenty-five years.</p>

<p>2. Change from five yearsâ to three yearsâ
service with the Colours.</p>

<p>3. Abolition of all exemptions from service; even the only sons of
widows, the eldest sons of orphans, and those whose brothers are
already serving, must serve one year, and may be sent away at its
conclusion; if, however, they have not given satisfaction in the
ranks, they may be kept on for another two years. Candidates for the
higher professions and theological students will have to serve for one
year, the latter to serve as bearers during active service.</p>

<p>4. One-year Volunteers to be drawn exclusively from students of
science, and from a few moderately high schools.</p>

<p>5. Payment of a military tax by all, and an extra one by those who
are unfit for service, and by any who are conscribed for less than
three years.</p>

<p>A final point is given to this law by stating that no one is to
accept a governmental or departmental office without having previously
served for five years in either Army or Navy, and during two of these
years to have served in the capacity of either officer or
non-commissioned officer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War-Strength.</div>

<p class="sind">The war-strength of France was, before
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the passing of this law, and according to French sources:â</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to calculate, from the new law, what her
strength will be exactly, but it appears to be nearly equal to that of
the three Powers together who form the Triple Alliance!</p>

<p>Whether this law has been promulgated in view of an approaching
war, or whether it will be carried out in all its Spartan severity
throughout the present peaceâand long may it last!âis a question only
to be determined by the future. In either case the spirit of
self-sacrifice which has prompted the French to lay the heavy burden
on themselves is much to be admired. The mainspring of this spirit
appears, however, to be more the frantic effort to get back the
countryâs former military prestige than pure patriotism.</p>

<p class="skip1">The peace-strength of France is no criterion by which

<p>The magazine rifle of the French Infantry, introduced in 1887, and
called after its inventor, Colonel Lebel, director of the Normal
School of Musketry at Chalons, is certainly equal to both the German
and Austrian magazine rifles in shooting and general value. As regards
the powder for its cartridges, the composition of which<a
id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> remains a secret up
till now, the inventor has claimed that its use will revolutionise
Infantry tactics. According to French accounts, the powder is both
noiseless and smokeless. If this were the case, no doubt it would
produce changes in the mode of fighting, and surprises would be
greatly facilitated thereby. Last year, however, experiments were made
at the German Artillery School and at the ManÅuvres with an almost
identical powder, the results of which proved that the advantages of
the French powder were greatly exaggerated.  The report of the rifle
is distinctly heard, and is little, if at all, less loud than that of
the old powder. The smoke, it is true, is very much less, but is still
quite visible on a still day, its colour being a transparent dull
blue. The new powder, therefore, certainly possesses advantages, but
these will be of little account when all armiesâas seems very probable
in the near futureâcome to use the same powder.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Lebel rifle is apparently being superseded by a
new rifle, that invented by Captain Pralon, and it is said that the
Rifle battalions will shortly be armed with it. The uniform of the
French Infantry is the same as it has been for the last forty years,
the main features in field-order being the long blue-grey great-coat,
red kÃ©pi and loose red trousers. The full dress is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
shako and double-breasted dark-blue tunic. The Rifle battalions wear
blue-grey trousers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">African Troops.</div>

<p class="sind">The foreign troops, chiefly African, form a
remarkable feature in the French Army; they consist of Zouaves,
Turcos, Foreign Legion, and Spahis, and take the field with the French
troops against any Power, civilised or otherwise.</p>

<p>The Zouaves were originally an Arab tribe, whom the French
conquered and forced to pay tribute. Their dress is picturesque,
consisting of an open blue jacket, red sash, loose red knickerbockers,
and white gaiters, their head-gear being a red fez with or without a
white turban.  At the present time, there are but few Africans amongst
them, the greater portion being Frenchmen, pure and simple.</p>

<p>The Turcos are natives of Algeria and Tunis, induced to enlist by a
bounty of Â£16. Their dress is similar to that of the Zouaves,
excepting that their knickerbockers are blue, or white, instead of
red.</p>

<p>Both Zouaves and Turcos have many attributes of good Light
Infantry. The former are renowned for their energy and activity in the
attack, and the latter for their stalking and crawling powers. As long
as there is a prospect of victory, these troops are full of
<i>Ã©lan</i> and courage, but a defeat takes much of their spirit out
of them.</p>

<p>Another peculiar body of troops are the five battalions of ZÃ©phyrs
Light African Infantry. They consist of very bad characters who are
sent to the Corps as a punishment for their crimes. They garrison
different districts in Algeria, as a rule the most unpleasant ones, and
though formerly never employed in Europe, will now be allowed to do so
in future wars.</p>

<p class="skip1">The French horse is not by a long way as lasting or
as fit for service as the German (<i>i.e.</i>, Lithuanian and
Hanoverian) horse.  Nor is the French Cavalry soldier a good
groom. The Chasseurs dâAfrique and the Spahis, mounted on Arabian
stallions, form exceptions to this rule. The Spahis are for the most
part natives of Africa, officered by Frenchmen. Their whole appearance
produces a novel impression, dressed as they are in their Oriental
attire of blue jacket and baggy breeches, long red-leather
riding-boots, with the white burnous slung over their shoulders, and
mounted on their sinewy little horses, which they guide at will with a
mere turn of the wrist. It is a strange sight to see these children of
the desert at their games, tearing along with wild war-shrieks and
waving their long guns frantically over their heads, each man
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and horse straining every muscle to be first in the race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Artillery.</div>

<p class="sind">The Field Artillery consists of 19 brigades (one
to each Army Corps), each of 2 regiments. One of these regiments has
12, the other 11 batteries, including between them 3 batteries of
Horse Artillery, so that each Army Corps has 23 batteries.  Each
battery has 6 guns, fully-horsed even in peace-time. Besides these,
some mountain batteries are going to be formed, but only in case of
need.</p>

<p>The Artillery is armed with an excellent (3Â·53-in.) gun, on the De
Bange system.  It was entirely re-armed with these after the 1870â71
campaign, and at an enormous cost.</p>

<p class="skip1">The Garrison Artillery, 16 battalions of 6 batteries
each, is also armed with first-rate new guns.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Engineers.</div>

<p class="sind">Of Engineers there are 4 regiments, each of 5
battalions. An independent Railway Regiment has lately been
formed.</p>

<p>The Corps of Gendarmerie, numbering as many as 25,000 men, is more
or less connected with the Army, for though in peace-time it is
employed on police-duty, in war-time it would be formed into as many
Field Divisions of military police as would be required for keeping
order in rear of the Army. The Garde-RÃ©publicaine of Paris (Cavalry
and Infantry), is a branch of the Gendarmerie, and not of the Army,
and the Regiment of Sapeurs-Pompiers, though militarily organised, is
in reality only the Fire Brigade.</p>

<p>The Train consists of 19 squadrons of 5 companies each.</p>

<p class="skip1">Besides the above troops, there are military corps
organised for Postal and Telegraph service in the field; also a
Balloon Corps, a Carrier-pigeon Corps, a Cyclist Corps, and a
Dog-training Corps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Military Schools.</div>

<p class="sind">There are numerous schools in France
intended either for military education or further military
instruction. Chief amongst them is the Military School of St. Cyr,
into which 400 candidates are admitted every year as cadets, after a
competitive examination.  The course lasts for two years, and the
cadets are then sent as 2nd lieutenants to the Infantry and Cavalry.
The Polytechnic School in Paris sends 250 cadets annually under like
conditions to the Artillery and Engineers.  In the time of Napoleon
I., a great many of the officers, including some of his most famous
marshals, rose from the ranks; and even now a very large proportion of
them come from the same source.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Total Forces.</div>

<p class="sind">The whole of France is divided for administrative
and organising purposes into 18 Regions, in each of which an Army
Corps is quartered. The 19th Corps is in Algeria.</p>

<p>Each Army Corps comprises 2 Infantry Divisions, each of 2 brigades
of 2 regiments each, besides a battalion of Rifles, a brigade of
Cavalry (2 regiments), and a brigade of Artillery.</p>

<p>On reviewing the size and organisation of the French Army, we cannot
help being struck by the fact that, besides being exceedingly numerous,
it is well organised, well armed, and endowed with a proper warlike
spirit. Although not âthe best in the world,â as every Frenchman will
tell you, the French soldier is possessed of many excellent and
soldier-like qualities. One cannot form oneâs judgment by the extremely
slack and unsmart appearance of the men, both as regards physique and
uniform. The âPiou-piou,â as the Infantry soldier is called by his
fellow-countrymen, who lounges about with his kÃ©pi well on the back of
his head and his hands deep in his baggy trouser-pockets, does
certainly not present a soldier-like appearance, but all the same he is
an active and handy man on service, and on the field of battle advances
pluckily through a murderous fire, with little thought of danger or
alarm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="fig026">

<p class="caption1">Chasseur dâAfrique.</p>
</div>

<p>If we now come to the question why, with an Army which has given
such numerous proofs in many campaigns of its valour and excellence,
France has not kept up her prestige, the answer is to be found, not in
the morale of the Army, but in that of France herself, a country in
which the spirit of order and subjection, and that stern devotion to
duty which is the foundation
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
of all discipline, have never taken root. Ambition and desire of
conquest form the motive-power of many great and glorious deeds, and
are certainly not wanting in the French character. Higher than these,
however, stands the feeling of duty which keeps a man at his post
through all hardships and perils, without a thought for his own gain
or loss, simply because he has learned to subject his will to a higher
one. On this foundation can be raised a discipline which permits of no
loosening of the bonds of training and order even in times of
disaster, and which keeps up the spirit of the Army and faith in its
final success even under the heaviest blows of misfortune. This
feeling cannot be learnt in a three yearsâ, nor five yearsâ, nor even
twenty-five yearsâ service, if it is not ingrained and actually born
in the national character and national system of education.  Without
these main features even universal conscription itself will not be
successful, and the recent Draconian law in France, although it may
bring forth vast masses of armed men, will not produce that feeling of
combined action and willingness to follow their leaders to the death
which is so characteristic of nations in whom the military spirit is
thoroughly implanted.</p>

<p>France is well-armed for attack as well as defence; for attack, by
means of the great armed masses which she can throw into the enemy
country at the first declaration of war, in conjunction with the
troops she has had stationed on her frontier during peace-time; and
for defence by means of a defensive system on a vast scale, the outer
line of which consists of frontier-fortresses and stop-gap forts from
the Swiss to the Belgian frontier, from Belfort, over the Vosges ridge
to Epinal, now a strong fortress, Toul and Verdun, on the right bank
of the Meuse. Behind this first line of defence a second one has been
built, consisting of entrenched camps between forty and fifty miles
apart, and reaching from Langres to Rheims. There are, in fact, but
few roads into France which are not covered by the fire of some
fortress or other. The central point of the whole of this vast
defensive system is the huge fortress of Paris, which, with her circle
of protecting forts surrounding her on a fifteen-mile radius, is more
like a fortified province than a fortress.</p>

<p>The secret of victory, however, does not lie in vast armaments like
these. âIt is the spirit which forms the bodyâ and brings into
subjection the material powers for its own objects. War is not only a
combat of material forces; it is in a higher sense a combat of
cultured forces. Let us, therefore, remember that the best preparation
for trial by combat does not lie in continual striving to over-reach
another in material and brute force, but in the striving after a more
complete development of warlike skill.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_46">Pp. 46, 47</a>. Now that the new law has come
into force, July 1890, the terms of service have been entirely
changed. As the law now stands, seven-tenths of the annual contingent
of recruits have to serve for 3 years, and three-tenths for 1 year.
After his colour-service, a man joins the Active Reserve for 7 (or 9)
years, then the Territorial Army for 6 years, and after that the
Territorial Reserve for 9 years moreâtotal 25 years.</p>

<p>312,000 youths reach the military age (20) every year. Of these
only 174,000 are required for colour-service. The effect of the new
law will be that by 1915 <span class="smcap2">A.D.</span> there will
be no fewer than 3,500,000 of Frenchmen properly trained as soldiers
and ready to take the field, and 60,000 trained men per annum will
have been added to the army!</p>

<p class="skip1">N.B.âThe war-strength of over 4,000,000 given on <a
href="#Page_47">page 47</a> includes all men, old and young, who have
ever received any military training, and is therefore hardly a just
estimate of the French fighting-strength.  The latest trustworthy
estimates put it at 2,790,000 men.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_49">P. 49</a>. The Cavalry is now, or will be very

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Russia</span> is situated, from
a military point of view, quite differently to any other European
country, for of the whole Russian Empire only about a quarter lies in
Europe. This quarter, it is true, is larger than the rest of all Europe
put together, but it contains only a third of the population. Although
by far the greater part of her dominions lies in another continent,
Russia has had a pretty large finger in the European pie, and will in
the future, no doubt, often mix herself up in European politics. Her
policy, if it can be called so, is to try to influence Western questions
in such a manner as eventually to bring all Slav races under her
rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">Russia has therefore organised her Army on an
European footing, and chiefly on the German model. In 1874 she brought
in Universal Conscription, from which, however, the upper classes,
<i>i.e.</i>, the nobility, the clergy, and officials, are exempt. The
actual Colour service lasts six years; after that the soldier is sent
for nine years more to the Reserve, which can be called out to
reinforce the Standing Army. During the rest of his time, <i>i.e.</i>,
up to his twentieth year of service he belongs to the Opoltschenieâa
body of men similar to the German Landsturm.</p>

<p>The number of able-bodied young men who annually attain the
requisite age, 21 years, comes to about 800,000. Of these only 225,000
are conscribed, and the requisite number for the Army are selected
from these by lot; the remainder are sent to the Opoltschenie. The
latter body, therefore, consists of a huge mass of men, but mostly
untrained. There is no middle body of men, like the German Landwehr,
in the Russian Army.</p>

<p>The Regular Army is divided into four bodies, according to the
respective duties required from them. They are the Field Forces,

Prussian tunic to a loose double-breasted jacket fastened with hook
and eye, and with no buttons. The head-gear is a round fur-cap, white
in the case of Generals and Staff-officers, and black in all
others. The soldier has little to do in the way of metal-polishing, it
is true, but still the eye misses the accustomed glint which one

sabre, called a âShashka,â which is worn on a narrow band over the
right shoulder. The front-ranks of the Cuirassiers and Lancers carry
lances on garrison-duty and on full-dress occasions, but these would
not be taken on service. The Dragoons carry a rifle, somewhat shorter

<p>There is no Train; it is formed in war-time by taking men from the

<p>During peace-time the Reserve forces, which would have to complete
the Army to war strength on its taking the field, and the Ersatz

practise new regulations, tactical and otherwise, as they are brought
out, and experimentalise with new arms

<p class="skip1">In addition to this enormous number there are the
Irregular troopsâa force quite peculiar to Russiaânamely, the
Cossacks.<a id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a
href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cossacks.</div>

<p class="sind">The Cossacks are tribes of mixed Russian, Turkish,
and Tatar blood. They are descended from tribes of horsemen, who after
the Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century settled on the Don and
Dnieper and established their own forms of government.  Every three
years they used to elect a âHetmanâ as chief, with a council of
elders, âNarschines,â to assist him. The Don Cossacks of Great Russia
have their head-quarters north of the Sea of Azov and in the
mountainous districts of that region.  Branches of these Cossacks have
settled on the Volga, on the shores of the Sea of Azov, along the
Ural, in the Kuban North-Western Caucasus and in Siberia. Ever since
they became subject to Russia they have assisted in carrying the
Russian dominion further into Asia. The history of the settlement of
these tribes in Siberia, led by the Cossack chief Jermac, is
exceedingly interesting. This bold leader crossed the Ural mountains
in 1758 with a following of only 840 Cossacks. His conquering progress
equalled that of the Spaniards under Cortez in Mexico for adventure
and for the great results that flowed from his successes.</p>

<p class="caption1">Cossack of the Caucasus.</p>
</div>

<p>Although attached to Russia, the Cossacks are Russian in neither
their language, religion, nor customs. Gifted with extraordinarily
sharp senses, good-humoured, and hospitable, born warriors, excellent
horsemen, and good shots, they are yet difficult to govern, and
inclined somewhat to insubordination. Now that they have been bound
down to stay in settled districts, instead of wandering all over the
country, their wildness has been somewhat toned down, and they are of
inestimable value to Russia in her service on the Chinese frontier, in
the Ural, in the Kuban, in Siberia, in the Crimea, and on the Seas of
Azov or of Aral. In return for lands granted by the government on the
different frontiers, every Cossack is bound to serve as a
soldier. They have a military organisation and are divided into
Cavalry regiments, or âpolks.â</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig030">
<img class="smallbw" alt=""

<p class="caption1">Officer of the Field<br />Police (full dress).</p>
</div>

<p>They are gradually being more and more definitely organised,
disciplined, and trained.  Each man has to provide himself with
clothing and equipment according to regulation, and with a horse, and
keep them up during his time of service. The uniform consists in a
short coat, âkasakin,â or a long one, âtcherkesska,â with a woollen
shirt, âbeshmet,â loose trousers, long boots, no spurs, and a fur-cap,
âpapasha.â Their
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
chief weapon is a long pennonless lance, with sabre (âshashkaâ),
pistol, or in the case of Cossacks of the Caucasus, long knives,
âkinzhal,â and finally, a rifle of some sort.</p>

<p class="skip1">Their small insignificant-looking horses are not to
be beaten for speed and endurance.  A day journey of twenty hours is
not too much for them; their hardiness is extraordinary, and the worst
forage possible does not come amiss to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cossack Charac&shy;teristics.</div>

<p class="sind">A Cossack rides in the Oriental manner,
<i>i.e.</i> with a loose rein, high saddle, short stirrup, and toes
down; he is very fond of his horse and treats him kindly.</p>

<p>Their extraordinary mobility, endurance, and cleverness in getting
over all obstacles of ground, particularly fit the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Cossack troops for outpost and reconnaissance duty, for rapid raids
and bold surprises, as well as for the pursuit of the enemy. What is
also by no means their least advantage is that this mode of employing
them in war would leave the regular Russian Cavalry free for actual
combat in the field.</p>

<div class="figleft" id="fig031">
<img class="smallbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig031.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Field Gendarme (service kit).</p>
</div>

<p>The Cossack Army which best shows the Cossack peculiarities of
character and organisation is that of the Don Cossacks, which numbers
in peace-time, besides the Bodyguard Regiment of Cossacks, 15
regiments of Cavalry, 1 battery of Guard-Cossacks, and 7 batteries of
the Line. In war-time these numbers can be considerably increased, and
the whole Cossack Army would amount to 14 battalions Infantry, 136
regiments Cavalry, and 40 Horse Batteries (236 guns).</p>

<p>This gipsy-like nation of horsemen, who eat, drink, sleep, live and
die in their saddles, and, eager for plunder, either precede the
Regular Army or attach themselves to it, is well known in Germany,
where it appeared during the Wars of the Liberation (1806â1815). One
might say with Schiller: âThe rider and his swift horse are fearsome
guests.â On the whole, it seems to be the fate of the Cossacks to be
regarded with feelings of greater respect as enemies than as
friends.</p>

<p class="skip1">Still less amenable to discipline than the Cossacks
are some of the other foreign tribes found amongst the Russian
Irregulars, such as the Tatars of the Crimea, the inhabitants of the
Caucasus, the Tcherkesses, the Bashkirs and the Tunguses. Although
these people render Russia most valuable service in her Asiatic
possessions, still she can hardly count on their services in an
European war, so that an invasion by these Asiatic races, like what
happened in the times of Tamerlane or Jengiz-Khan, need not be taken
into account by the Europe of to-day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conclu&shy;sions.</div>

<p class="sind">Laying aside the question of these Irregular
troops, we cannot deny that Russia possesses a well-disciplined Army,
and one which is prepared for war. It is a mistaken idea to imagine
the Russian soldier to be half a barbarian and a foe to higher
culture. Frederick the Great learnt to respect Russia as a powerful
adversary, and in the beginning of this century she brought a heavy
weight to bear in favour of Austria and Prussia, and fought valiantly
as their ally against the power of Napoleon I. Since that period
Russia has made important progress, not only in her culture, but in
the organisation and arming of her Army; universal conscription has
also acted as a powerful assistant to universal education. Whether
Russia will fight Germany in the near or in the distant future is a
matter that does not concern us here; we will leave the discussion of
the probabilities pro and con to the newspapers.  The time may come,
but all we need know about the matter is that Germany is fully
prepared and, though respecting her possible adversary, is not afraid
of her.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> military
organisations of the Great Powers of Europe have served as patterns to
the smaller Powers, for even the smallest State must have an Army of its
own wherewith to defend its independence and secure the vindication of
its rights, actual or imaginary. Its strength would depend on the size,
geographical situation, and historical associations of the State.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Historical.</div>

<p class="sind">In recent times the small State of Denmark has
once or twice been obliged to have recourse to arms, in order to keep
possession of the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein, to the right of
attaching which to the Danish crown, or rather to their absorption
into the Danish commonwealth, Prussia objected. In the year 1848â49
the small Danish Army succeeded in making such a gallant stand against
the might of Prussia, that time was gained for other great Powers,
namely, Russia and England, to step in in her favour. The result was
that Prussia was obliged to stay her hand from taking under her
protection the German inhabitants of the two Duchies.</p>

<div class="figright" id="fig033">
<img class="smallbw" alt=""

<p class="caption1">Foot Guardsman.</p>
</div>

<p class="skip1">In 1863â64, when Prussia and Austria took in hand the
German rights in the Duchies, circumstances were considerably altered,
and the war, which lasted a whole year, was brought at last to a close
by the Treaty of Vienna, which once and for all separated the Duchies
from Denmark and gave them to Prussia. The resolution and courage,
however, with which the men of the tiny Danish Army withstood the
vastly superior forces of the other two Powers, and the determined
opposition which they offered, more especially in their fortifications
at Danewirke, Duppel, and the Island of Alsen, until their last hope
of foreign intervention had gone, bear most honourable testimony to
the excellence and courage of the Danish troops.</p>

<div class="sidenote skip1">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">After this war Denmark made use of her bitter
experience in reorganising her Army on new lines, a proof that she
had, in spite of the loss of her lands, by no means given up the idea
of being a Power in the North of Europe. She has now made an important
step in the military line by introducing universal conscription, the
terms of which are four years with the Colours, four in the Reserve,
and eight in the âReinforcementâ Reserve.</p>

<p>The total strength of the Danish Army is reckoned at about 50,000
men, with 128 guns. The Reinforcement Reserve battalions and batteries
only exist as depÃ´t-cadres.</p>

<p>The Infantry is still armed with a single-loading rifle, the
Remington, but it is intended to shortly arm them with a
magazine-rifle, which is now in course of preparation.</p>

<p>The Cavalry is armed with the sabre and Remington carbine. Their
Jutland horses are clumsy, but enduring, animals. Recently large
purchases of horses have been made in Germany to improve the
breed.</p>

<p>The Danish character is better adapted for stout resistance and
endurance than for daring courage, and the Army accordingly is better
fitted for a defensive rÃ´le, such as holding a fortified position to
the last extremity, than for offensive action and bold attack.</p>

<p>The general plan of national defence is based on this
characteristic, for the capital, Copenhagen, is going to be turned
into a great entrenched camp, which would be garrisoned by the larger
portion of the Danish Army in case of war.</p>

the time of the Thirty Yearsâ War, represented the first Military Power
in Europe, keeps up now only a small Army, just large enough for the
needs of the country. The military system of Sweden is a peculiar one,
and entirely different from that of other States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military System.</div>

<p class="sind">The whole land is divided into a great many small
âRoteâ or Divisions, each of which has to supply one able-bodied man
of the right age for the Army. This man serves for as long as his
physical powers last. He receives a small property, consisting of
house, farm, and ploughland, and definite pay as long as he is
actually with the Colours.</p>

<p>Men for the Cavalry are provided in a very similar manner with
their horses by the larger landowners or âRusthalters,â in return for
their exemption from certain taxes.</p>

<p>These troops are called âIndeltaâ men.</p>

<p>The second portion of the Swedish Army consists of the âVÃ¤rfvade,â
the men of which body enlist voluntarily for from two to six yearsâ
service, and may re-engage for further service.</p>

<p>The VÃ¤rfvade men can be trained much more thoroughly than those of
the Indelta, for the former are continually with their Corps, whilst
the latter are, during the greater part of the year, on furlough,
looking after their farms.</p>

<p class="skip1">The third portion is the âBewÃ¤ring,â which consists
of all men between their twenty-first and twenty-sixth years of age.

directed by a sergeant in the centre with uplifted rifle.  Every time
a man in the firing-line snaps his rifle, he shouts out âPiff-paff!â
The introduction of a new magazine-rifle will, therefore, probably
cause some fatigue to the throats of the Swedish Infantry.</p>

This, however, was for a long time not the case in the south-western

the case, for during even this century revolution has succeeded
revolution, and the different forms of government introduced at
rapidly-recurring intervals have made it impossible for the Army to be
always at the beck and call of the head of the State for the time being.
The energetic young king, Alfonso XII., who ascended the Spanish throne
in 1874 (and died in 1885), experienced the necessity of making himself
chief of the Army, and instituted a military system by which he hoped to

would now count as one of the best soldiers in Europe if it were not
that, in consequence of the long civil wars and disturbances in the
country, he had become somewhat less amenable to discipline than
formerly. If an instance is required of what Spaniards can do when
fighting for their land and freedom, we have only to look at the
guerilla and mountain warfare waged by this plucky nation against the
old campaigners of Napoleon at the beginning of this century, before
the English troops came to their assistance.</p>

<h3>PORTUGAL.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">Universal Conscription is the rule in Portugal as well as in most
other countries, but there are numerous exemptions and sendings on
âunlimited furlough with the Coloursâ (in order to save the national
exchequer), so that the Army does not by any means comprise as many
men as would appear from the strength as laid down on paper. With a
nominal peace strength of 37,000, the actual strength is only about
18,000.</p>

<p class="skip1">The terms of service are three years with the
Colours, five years in the 1st Class, and four in the 2nd Class
Reserves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organisa&shy;tion.</div>

<p class="sind">The Infantry consists of 24 Line and 12 Rifle
regiments, each of 2 Active and 1 DepÃ´t battalions, altogether 72
battalions, the DepÃ´t battalions being skeleton ones.</p>

<p>Cavalryâ10 regiments, of which the first two are Lancers, and the
remainder Light Dragoons (CaÃ§adores a Cavallo).  Each regiment
consists of 3 Active and 1 DepÃ´t squadrons.</p>

<p>Artilleryâ3 Regiments of Field Artillery of 12 batteries each, 2
Regiments of Garrison Artillery of 12 companies each, 1 Mountain
Brigade of 6 batteries.âTotal, 32 Active and 10 Reserve batteries with
132 guns.</p>

<p>Engineersâ2 Active and 1 Reserve battalions, and 1 Torpedo
Company.</p>

<p>Portugal has, besides this Army, a Colonial Force of 9,600 men,
chiefly natives.</p>

<p>The Infantry is now armed with the Kropatschek repeating-rifle;
till quite recently, they had the Enfield rifle. The Field Artillery
is chiefly armed with 3Â·54-inch steel Krupp guns.</p>

<p>More attention appears to be paid in Portugal to the Navy than to
the Army, and it seems unlikely that the latter will be engaged in
war, at all events for some time to come.</p>

</div>

<p class="skip1">The Swiss Republic, or rather the Free Confederation
of twenty-two small Republics (Cantons), had its beginning in the four
âForestâ towns of Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, and Glarus. It was by the
treaties of 1815, upon which, after the downfall of Napoleon I., the
present distribution of Powers was founded and still to a great extent
remains, that the neutrality of Switzerland was recognised, so that
she is now, to all intents and purposes, excluded from taking part in
an European war. Being, however, surrounded by three Great Powers,
whose Armies may at any time traverse her territories from any
quarter, she is obliged to guard her neutrality very strictly. This
object she seeks to accomplish by universal conscription and by a
military system which is adapted to the exigencies of the country and
rests on the so-called âMilitia System.â</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">According to this system the conscript has to pass
only a few weeks or months in being trained, and is subsequently
called out for only a few weeks annually during peace-time. This
system certainly allows of universal service in the widest sense of
the word, and also gives a small State the power of calling out a
proportionally large Army in time of war. At the same time, however,
this system, in order to be of any use, would require the people to be
naturally of a warlike tendency, and every man to be thoroughly
accustomed to the use of a rifle; in fine, it would require that there
should always be a nucleus of thoroughly-trained troops, even in
peace-time.</p>

<p>Every Swiss is liable to service from the 20th to the 44th year of
his age. Of these twenty-five years of service, thirteen are spent in
the âAuszugâ (Active Army) and twelve in the âLandwehr.â All
able-bodied men between the ages of 17 to 50 who are not employed in
either of the above branches belong to the âLandsturm.â Anyone who is
not fit to serve has to pay a small fine as a sort of
compensation.</p>

<p class="skip1">In case of war the âAuszugâ would provide the Army as
follows:â</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organisa&shy;tion.</div>

<p class="noindent">Infantryâ98 Fusilier and 8 Rifle Battalions.</p>

<p class="hang4">Cavalryâ8 Regiments (24 squadrons) of Dragoons and 12
Companies of Guides.</p>

<p class="hang4">Artilleryâ24 Regiments of Field Artillery, and 1 of
Mountain Artillery, each of 2 batteries of 6 guns
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
eachâtotal, 300 guns, besides 10 batteries of Position Artillery.</p>

<p class="noindent">Engineersâ9 Battalions.</p>

<p class="noindent skip1">Trainâ8 Battalions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strength of Army.</div>

<p class="sind">The strength of the Field Army comes to about 100,000 men. It
consists of the Army Staff and 8 Divisions, each comprising 2 Infantry
Brigades, each Brigade comprising 2 Regiments of Infantry, 1 Rifle
Battalion, 1 Regiment of Dragoons, 1 Company of Guides, 1 Brigade of
Artillery, 1 Battalion of Engineers, 1 of Train, 1 Field Hospital and
1 Administration Company.</p>

<p>The Landwehr consists of nearly as many men as the Auszug, but the
former are only called on to serve on garrison duty at home. As for
arms, the Swiss troops are not behindhand with other nations. The
Infantry is armed with the repeating Vetterli rifle, the Rifles with a
similar short repeating-rifle, and the Dragoons with a
repeating-carbine. The Field Artillery has three patterns of guns: the
light 3Â·28-in., the heavy 3Â·93-in., and the mountain 2Â·92-inch
guns. The Swiss soldier is more of a Light Infantry man than anything
else; as for the Swiss Cavalry, it is not to be considered on the same
footing as the Cavalry of other nations, being feeble.</p>

<p>The Swiss Militiaman is trained for a short time and then sent home
with his uniform and rifle. Thereafter he appears yearly for a short
training, in order to âkeep his eye in.â This sketchy military
education is, however, greatly helped by the numerous Cadet divisions
in the schools, and by Volunteer Rifle and Gymnastic clubs.</p>

<p class="skip1">The âKingdom of the Netherlands,â instituted by the
Vienna Congress in 1815, was, after the revolt of the southern
provinces, divided into two kingdoms, Holland and Belgium, the former
extending from the mouth of the Ems to those of the Rhine, Maas, and
Scheldt, and the latter from these mouths to the north-eastern
frontier of France. The neutrality of these two States, recognised by
the other Great Powers of Europe, have so far exempted them from
keeping up large standing armies, that their organisation remains very
much as it was in 1830.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">The Dutch military system is a combination of the
old Voluntary Enlistment and the Militia systems. Every able-bodied
young man between 20 and 25 years of age is bound to enter the
Militia; the number of these not to exceed 11,000 annually. The length
of service of these men, nominally one year, is as a matter of fact
shortened to nine or even six months.</p>

<p class="caption1">Infantry of the Schutterij.</p>
</div>

<p class="skip1">The Army consists partly of voluntarily-enlisted men,
who bind themselves to six yearsâ service, and partly of Militiamen.
Gaps are often caused by the impossibility of filling Volunteer
vacancies by Militiamen, and this leads to the disadvantage that the
training of the Militiamen is not so thorough as it might be, and also
that the troops are not always kept up to their full
establishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organisa&shy;tion.</div>

<p class="sind">The Standing Dutch Army consists ofâ</p>

<p class="hang4">Infantryâ1 Grenadier and Rifle Regiment (comprising 3
battalions of Grenadiers and 2 of Rifles), and 8 Line Regiments of 5
battalions eachâGrand total, 45 battalions.</p>

<p class="hang4">Cavalryâ3 Regiments of Hussars, each of 5 Field and
one DepÃ´t squadrons.</p>

Field Artillery, altogether 42 batteries with 252 guns: and 4
regiments of Garrison Artillery.</p>

<p class="hang4">Engineersâ3 Field Companies, 3 Fortress, 1 Railway
and Telegraph Company, and 1 Instruction and DepÃ´t Company.</p>

<p class="skip1">Besides the above there is a Colonial Army DepÃ´t of
three companies, and the Corps of MarÃ©chaussÃ©e, which corresponds to
the Gendarmerie in other States, 373 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strength of Army.</div>

<p class="sind">The total strength of the Active Army
approaches 64,000 men and 270 guns. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Colonial Army, recruited entirely by voluntary enlistment, comes to
about 30,000 men.</p>

<p>In case a necessity should arise for reinforcing the Dutch Army,
another body of men has been formed, called the âSchutterij,â of all
Dutchmen between their 20th and 30th years not included in the Active
Army or Militia.  No great expectations can be formed of this body,
for the members are only trained for forty to fifty hours
annually.</p>

<p>The Landsturm and Rifle Clubs are also destined to increase the
strength of the Army in case of emergency.</p>

<p>Since Holland has been declared a neutral State, and her energy is
chiefly devoted to the furthering of her commercial and colonial
interests, the chief duty of the Army will probably be confined to
that of national defence. The numerous sluices and canals, which would
offer numerous obstacles to an invading army, would be of great
assistance in case of war. It has, in fact, already happened that the
country has been saved by letting in the sea through the sluices and
forming a general inundation.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the inhabitants of Europe were several times
alarmed by a common danger, that of invasion of their territories by a
foreign race, Asiatic by extraction, and connected primarily with the
Mongols. This race, known as Turks or Osmanli, had made itself master of
Constantinople, the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire, in 1453, and
set up its government there under a Padishah or Sultan. From this point
they extended their empire further and further to the north-west, over
Hungary and the intervening lands, and took possession of the Hungarian
capital, Buda, or Ofen. In 1683 they actually besieged Vienna, and this
city would undoubtedly have fallen if it had not been for its heroic
defence by Field-Marshal RÃ¼diger von Starhemberg,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
who held out till he was succoured by Duke Charles of Lorraine with the
Army of the Austrian Empire, and John Sobieski, King of Poland.</p>

<p>The Turkish power now began to wane, and its forces gradually
declined in strength during the wars with Russia in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries. One by one the provinces of the Turkish Empire
became detached from Turkish rule and proclaimed their independence
under their own sovereigns. In this way arose the independent kingdoms
of Greece, Servia, and Roumania, and the principality of Bulgaria
(under Turkish suzerainty), all of them during the present
century. Eastern Roumelia is still in the hands of the Turks, but she
has her own administration.  The Turkish Empireâonce the terror of
Christendomâis now fighting for very existence, and to retain her hold
over the small remnants of her European possessions.  Russia, who
considers herself the champion of the Greek-Catholic Church in the
East, would by this time have undoubtedly seized the lands of the
âSick Manâ on the Bosphorus, if it were not that the ambition of other
Powers has secured a frail but fleeting life for him. Since, however,
Turkey is determined not to let go of her European possessions without
a stiff fight for them, and since no one can foretell what
far-reaching consequences such a war would entail, we must not skip
her over, but must give a short account of her Army as well as of the
others.</p>

<p>Turkey has now, since the disbanding of the Janissaries (who formed
the Sultan body-guard, of 12,000 men at first, and later of 100,000),
organised her Army on a purely European footing. The officer who is
chiefly responsible for this organisation, and who was sent for that
purpose to Turkey, at the request of the then Sultan Mahmoud II., from
1835 to 1839, is no less a personage than Field-Marshal Count
Moltke.</p>

<p class="skip1">Since his time, the Turkish Army has improved after
every war. Though it is yet by no means equal to that of any of the
great Powers, still that is the fault of neither the military system
nor yet of the Turkish soldier. The responsibility lies with the
confused system of military administration, which deals in the most
hopeless and in the worst possible way with the clothing and
equipment, and even with the feeding and pay of the Army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Terms of Service.</div>

<p class="sind">According to the Law, every able-bodied Mahomedan
inhabitant of Turkey is bound to serve in the Army. Christians are
exempted on payment of a fine.</p>

<p class="skip1">Service in the âNizam,â or Active Army, lasts six
years, of which the Infantry soldier spends three and the Cavalry and
Artilleryman four years with the Colours and the remaining time in the
Active Reserve or âIkhtiat.â After this the soldier joins the Landwehr
or âRedifâ for eight years, and subsequently six years in the
Landsturm or âMuhstafiz.â As a matter of fact, the period of service

<p class="sind">The whole Turkish Empire is divided into 7
military districts or âOrdu,â of which the seventh, Arabia, is
exceptionally constituted.  âOrdusâ 1 to 6 have each in peace-time to
supply 1 Army Corps of Nizam troops, and, besides this, 1 to 2 Army
Corps of the Redif in case of necessity.  The seventh Ordu only
possesses 1 Army Corps altogether.</p>

<p>Each Corps consists of 2 Infantry Divisions, 2 Cavalry Divisions, 1
Regiment
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of Field Artillery, 1 battalion of Pioneers and 1 of the Train.</p>

<p>A Division consists of 2 brigades; an Infantry brigade numbers 2,
and a Cavalry 3, regiments. A regiment of Infantry numbers 5
battalions, of which 1 is a DepÃ´t battalion; a regiment of Cavalry, 5
squadrons, of which 1 is a DepÃ´t squadron.</p>

<p>The Artillery Regiment numbers 14 batteries, of which 3 are Horse
Artillery and 2 mountain batteries, each of 6 guns.</p>

<p class="skip1">The 18 Army Corps of the Turkish Field Army,
(including Redif) comprise a strength of 612,000 men, with 1,512
guns,<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a
href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and these could be
heavily reinforced by drawing on the âMuhstafiz.â</p>

<div class="sidenote">Armament.</div>

<p class="sind">The Infantry is armed with three different
patterns of rifles at this moment, but will shortly be armed
altogether with a magazine-rifle.  Cavalry and Field Artillerymen are
armed with a repeating carbine. The guns are good cast-steel
breech-loaders from the Krupp works. The mountain batteries have steel
guns.</p>

<p>As regards discipline and training, the Turkish soldier cannot be
compared on the same grounds with his European comrade.  As for a
discipline founded on feelings of honour, respect, and love of
country, the Turks wots not of it. These feelings are, however,
compensated for to some extent by a religious fanaticism and a warlike
spirit.</p>

<p>The Turkish soldier is easily satisfied, quiet in his demeanour,
unruffled, sparing of words, dignified, obedient, and true to the
death. The romantic halo which formerly endowed the Turks with
unequalled fighting powers in the assault and unconquerable
stubbornness in the defence of strong positions, has faded. In vain
does one now look for the Spahis and Delhis on their fiery horses,
with crooked swords, flashing turbans and waving garments.  With the
exception of the red fez, the uniform of the Turkish troops has a
distinctly European cut. The âNizamâ wear a dark-blue coat, usually
wide in the body, to allow of the growth and alterations of the body,
which take place during their six yearsâ service, and the âRedifâ wear
jackets or sleeved waistcoats. The most adventurous-looking are the
Bashi-Bazouks (<i>i.e.</i> âlost headsâ), a wild body of Irregular
troops who carry on war in their own fashion, and who are little
amenable to discipline.  These wear bizarre and wild-looking dresses,
and are armed with long rifles. The Army is extremely plucky in war,
but is sadly deficient in good officers and non-commissioned
officers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The armies of the smaller States of the Balkan Peninsula, organised
on the lines of great European Powers, will in future wars probably
only act as allies to either Russia or Turkey. We need therefore cast
but a hasty glance at them.</p>

<p class="sind"><i>Montenegro.</i> In the western portion of the

though not touching the latter, lies a wild and craggy mountain
land. According to the inhabitants, âWhen the Creator was walking over
the earth, distributing rocks and plains, the bag in which the rocks
were split, and those which remained fell on to Montenegro.â</p>

<p class="caption1">Montenegro: Soldier.</p>
</div>

<p>There can certainly not have been many rocks in the bag, for the
land of the Black Mountains (Montenegro or Tzernagora) is a tiny
country of only about 2,300 square miles. The inhabitants are as wild
as their country. They are a small, liberty-loving nation, of great
physical beauty, and born warriors. When the Czar, the other day,
called the Prince of Montenegro the best friend he had on earth, his
speech probably referred less to the Prince himself than to the people
whose merit and determined bravery he so much admired.</p>

<p>This nation has for centuries known how to preserve its
independence. Turkey, who tried to exercise a sovereignty, over the
people, came to grief when met by their determined opposition. In 1862
the inhabitants of Herzegovina rebelled against the sovereignty of the
Crescent, and were supported in their revolt by the Montenegrins. The
Turkish Government thereupon recalled their best general, Omar
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Pasha, from exile, and gave him the chief command of the forces sent
against Herzegovina and her ally.</p>

<img class="smallbw" alt=""
     src="images/fig048.jpg" />
<p class="caption1">Montenegro: Officer.</p>
</div>

<p>Omar Pasha forced his way into Montenegro at the head of a powerful
Army. His forces were so superior to those of the Montenegrins that
the latter could not keep up their brave opposition for very long, but
the Turkish losses were so considerable, and their enemy so impossible
to get at, that the former were glad when the Montenegrins showed
themselves willing to treat for peace on easy conditions. Montenegro,
therefore, stands to this day a rocky fortress and a bulwark against
the advance of the Crescent.</p>

<p>Montenegro requires no law of universal conscription, for every
able-bodied man has, as a matter of course, been trained to arms from
his youth up. It has also no Standing Army, only a Body-Guard for the
Prince, composed of 300 men,<a id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23"
class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of whom 50 are mounted. It is, however,
stated that at least 35,000 men and a few mountain-guns could be put
in the field in case of war, in order to defend the country against an
invader from any quarter.</p>

with foreign nations is taken into accountâin the naval development of
England. The late great Naval Review, however, last August, appeared

the British Fleet. There were at that time, off Portsmouth, several

<p>The original plan for forming a fleet, started in 1872â73, has been
departed from in several details, gained from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
experience of other nations and from the knowledge of German
requirements; economy had also something to do with the matter. The
building of huge ironclads was not persevered in, and more attention
was paid to increasing the torpedo-flotilla for the defence of the
coasts and ports.</p>

<p>Although the Imperial Navy is not yet strong enough to compete
successfully with those of other great naval powers on the open sea,
still one great object has been gained, <i>i.e.</i>, the protection of
trade and the merchant service. Germany is also now enabled to enter
into commercial and political relations with distant countries, and to
make the German flag respected in all parts of the world in a way
which would not otherwise have been possible.  The Navy will also be
able in the future to defend the German coast-line and make the
foreign invasion of her coasts an impossibility.  It is difficult to
forecast the probable development of the German Navy, for the colonies
which the country has recently founded and is still founding will
increase its task and may lead to the formation of a much larger
fleet.</p>

<p>The recognition which the German Navy has lately won on all sides,
especially on the part of England, allows of the hope that it will
soon be considered as fit to go hand in hand with the German Army.
One thing is certain, and that is, that its successes, whether in the
hoisting of the national flag in distant parts of the world, or in the
more peaceful task of cementing friendly relations with other Powers,
are followed with the greatest interest and appreciation by the whole
of the German Empire.</p>

War Office. In two parts, with case of Maps. Part I.  contains the
Events leading up to the Nile Expedition, and its History to the
Departure of the Desert Column from Korti. Part II., from the
Departure of the Desert Column to the conclusion of the Campaign.</p>

<p>âWhatever may be thought of general history, there is no doubt that
military history is written with a definite object. The soldier studies
a past campaign in order the better to be able to conduct a future
one.... For the soldier Colonel Colvilleâs book is a mine of valuable
information. Its military lessons are summoned up in one wordâtransport.
From Cairo to Khartoum is 1000 miles in a straight line, and 1400 miles
by the Nile. The country affords no supplies. The problem, therefore,
was to move a small army to within a practicable distance of Khartoum in
such a way that it may be fed during its advance, and when at its
destination may still have stores to last for some time. The official
history shows how this problem was solved, and how infinitely difficult
it was. The British army never came out more brilliantly from any trial
than from this contest with the wilderness.ââ<i>Manchester
Guardian.</i></p>

<p class="hang6"><span class="eyresf">MANUAL FOR ARMY MEDICAL
SERVICES.</span> By W. E. <span class="smcap">Riordan</span>,
<br />Surgeon-Major, Medical Staff.</p>

<p>âAlthough it is primarily no doubt intended for
medical officers, yet it embraces such a range of important
information as must render it of use to every branch of the service,
and even to civilians who want a book of the kind for handy
reference. While he takes the official War Office regulations and
manuals to build upon, and freely lays under tribute the regulations
of every branch of the service, yet the result is no mere dry
compilation of Army Acts and Orders, but a book full of original and
collected matter of a most useful and interesting character.... The
modern army medical officer has no longer, like his predecessor, to
grope about for want of definite instructions; with his new medical
regulations in one pocket, and this volume in the other, he can safely
take up any duty. We heartily congratulate Surgeon-Major Riordan on
his really admirable book; and as his best reward may he find it,
where it deserves to be, in the hands of every medical officer,
whether of the regular or the auxiliary forces.ââ<i>The British
Medical Journal.</i></p>

<p class="skip1">âThis useful volume is in the nature of a
supplement to the War Office Regulations upon which it is based. It
fills in the details which they necessarily lack, and elucidates and
explains them; and it is, moreover, a comprehensive handbook to all
matters which affect the physical well-being of the soldier.ââ<i>Army

from its earnest support of all measures for the good of the

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE<br />
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 1. General Terms">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 2. The Mission of Project Gutenberg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 3. The Project Gutenberg Literary">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 4. Donations to PGLAF">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pgx" title="Section 5. Project Gutenberg Electronic Works">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
